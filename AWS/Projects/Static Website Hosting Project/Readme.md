# üåê Static Website Hosting on AWS

This project demonstrates how to host a fully functional static website using AWS services. It leverages Amazon S3 for file storage, Route 53 for DNS management, and CloudFront for secure, low-latency content delivery with HTTPS support.

The goal is to create a scalable and cost-effective static website architecture using AWS-native tools with a custom domain and SSL certificate.
