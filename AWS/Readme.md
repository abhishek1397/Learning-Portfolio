# 🚀 AWS Cloud Project

This repo contains modern, scalable applications built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), that integrates various AWS services to provide high availability, security, and automation.

## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains the infrastructure code and application components for deploying a cloud-native service on AWS. It includes:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using [e.g. CloudFormation]
- Scalable compute (e.g., EC2, Lambda)
- Storage (e.g., S3, RDS, DynamoDB)
- Networking (e.g., VPC, Load Balancers)
- Monitoring and Logging (e.g., CloudWatch)
- CI/CD pipeline integration (e.g., GitHub Actions, CodePipeline)  (still working on it)

## 📦 Features

- Fully automated provisioning
- Modular infrastructure setup
- Follows AWS best practices
- Secure and scalable
- Easy to extend or customize

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.)
- [Terraform/CDK/CloudFormation]
- [Python/]
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
