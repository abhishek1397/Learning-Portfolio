* [ ] Derive estimators in stratified sampling and their variances
* [ ] Learn systematic sampling and properties of systematic estimator
* [ ] Apply stratified and systematic sampling to real datasets

---

### **Chapter 4: Unequal Probability Sampling**

* [ ] Study Probability Proportional to Size With Replacement (PPSWR)
* [ ] Learn Probability Proportional to Size Without Replacement (PPSWOR)
* [ ] Understand Midzuno method and Murthyâ€™s estimator
* [ ] Apply unequal probability sampling to survey problems

---

### **Chapter 5: Ratio and Regression Estimation**

* [ ] Define ratio estimation and derive bias & variance
* [ ] Apply regression estimation and analyze properties

### **Chapter 6: Cluster and Multi-Stage Sampling**

* [ ] Define cluster sampling with equal and unequal cluster sizes
* [ ] Derive estimators for population mean/total in cluster sampling
* [ ] Study two-stage sampling with equal number of second-stage units
* [ ] Apply multi-stage sampling to large-scale surveys (e.g., NSSO, census surveys)
