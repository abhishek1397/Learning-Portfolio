### **Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Probability & Random Variables**

* [ ] Basics of probability theory (axioms, conditional probability, Bayes theorem)
* [ ] Concept of random variables (discrete & continuous)
* [ ] Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)
* [ ] Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and survival function
* [ ] Expectation, variance, skewness, kurtosis
* [ ] **Industry case:** Random variables in risk modeling & option pricing

---

### **Chapter 2: Discrete Distributions & Applications**

* [ ] Bernoulli and Binomial distribution (applications in quality control, trading wins/losses)
* [ ] Geometric and Negative Binomial (modeling number of trials before success)
* [ ] Hypergeometric distribution (applications in sampling without replacement)
* [ ] Poisson distribution (applications in call arrivals, claims, high-frequency trading events)
* [ ] Poisson process and exponential waiting time
* [ ] **Industry case:** Poisson for fraud detection & rare events in finance

---

### **Chapter 3: Continuous Distributions & Applications**

* [ ] Uniform distribution (random number generation, Monte Carlo methods)
* [ ] Exponential distribution (time until failure, queueing models)
* [ ] Normal distribution (CLT, financial returns modeling)
* [ ] Log-normal distribution (stock prices, option pricing models)
* [ ] Gamma and Chi-square distributions (variance testing, reliability)
* [ ] Beta distribution (Bayesian modeling, portfolio weights)
* [ ] **Industry case:** Normal vs. heavy-tailed distributions in stock markets

---

### **Chapter 4: Generating Functions & Advanced Concepts**

* [ ] Moment generating function (MGF) – definition & properties
* [ ] Characteristic function – definition & applications in finance
* [ ] Cumulants and their interpretations
* [ ] Relationships between distributions using MGFs (e.g., sum of random variables)
* [ ] **Industry case:** Using characteristic functions in option pricing (Fourier methods)

---

### **Chapter 5: Correlation, Regression & Applications**

* [ ] Covariance and correlation between random variables
* [ ] Linear regression model – estimation & interpretation
* [ ] Multiple regression and multicollinearity
* [ ] Correlation in time series (autocorrelation)

---

### **Chapter 6: Sampling Distributions & Statistical Inference**

* [ ] Sampling distribution of sample mean and variance
* [ ] Central Limit Theorem and its importance in finance
* [ ] t-distribution, F-distribution, Chi-square distribution
* [ ] Estimation (point & interval) and hypothesis testing
* [ ] Bootstrapping & resampling techniques for modern analytics
* [ ] **Industry case:** Confidence intervals in portfolio returns & risk estimation

---

✅ **Capstone Project (Industry-Oriented):**

* [ ] Apply discrete & continuous distributions to a **real-world finance dataset** (e.g., stock prices, insurance claims, loan defaults).
* [ ] Use **Poisson & exponential** for modeling rare events like fraud detection.
* [ ] Use **normal/log-normal** to model returns and volatility.
* [ ] Perform **regression analysis** to forecast prices or demand.
* [ ] Demonstrate **sampling distribution concepts** in risk estimation and simulation.
