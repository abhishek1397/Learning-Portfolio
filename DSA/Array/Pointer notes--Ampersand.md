# 🔗 Understanding the Ampersand (`&`) Symbol in C++

In C++, the ampersand symbol `&` has **two primary meanings** depending on the context:

---

## 📍 1. Address-of Operator

When used **before a variable**, the `&` symbol acts as the **address-of operator**, which returns the **memory address** of that variable.

This is commonly used when assigning the address of a variable to a pointer.

### ✅ Example:

```cpp
int var = 10;
int* ptr = &var; // ptr now stores the memory address of var
````

* `&var` gives the address of `var`.
* `ptr` is a pointer to an `int`, so it can store that address.

---

## 📌 2. Reference Declaration

When used **in a variable or function parameter declaration**, `&` means the variable is a **reference**.

A **reference** is an **alias** — another name — for an existing variable. It doesn't create a new variable but simply refers to the same memory location.

### ✅ Example:

```cpp
int original = 20;
int& ref = original; // ref is now an alias for original
ref = 30;            // original also becomes 30
```

* `ref` and `original` refer to the **same memory**.
* Changing `ref` changes `original`.

---

## 📌 Reference to a Pointer

You can also declare a **reference to a pointer**, which is useful when you want to allow a function to **modify the pointer itself**, not just the value it points to.

### ✅ Example:

```cpp
void changePointer(int*& p) {
    p = nullptr; // Modifies the original pointer passed to the function
}
```

### Usage:

```cpp
int* myPtr = new int(42);
changePointer(myPtr);
// Now myPtr == nullptr
```

* `int*& p` declares `p` as a **reference to a pointer to int**.
* This allows the function to **change the caller's pointer**, not just what it points to.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Symbol Usage | Meaning                       | Example              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `&var`       | Address-of operator           | `int* ptr = &var;`   |
| `int& ref`   | Reference to an integer       | `int& r = original;` |
| `int*& p`    | Reference to a pointer to int | `void func(int*& p)` |

---

## 🧠 Quick Tips

* `&var` → gets the address of `var`
* `int& ref` → creates a reference (alias) to `int`
* `int*& ptrRef` → reference to a pointer
* References must be initialized when declared and cannot be null

---

> ℹ️ Use references when you want to avoid copying large objects or when you need to modify the original variable passed into a function.
