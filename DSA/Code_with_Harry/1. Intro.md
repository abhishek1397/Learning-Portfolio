# üìò Foundations of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Memory Management

---

## 1. Data Structures vs. Algorithms

### **Data Structures**

* **Definition:** Formalized methods of organizing and storing data in **RAM** (main memory) so that operations on the data can be performed efficiently.

* **Role in computing:**

  * Reduce memory wastage.
  * Minimize access and retrieval time.
  * Support scalability when problem size grows.

* **Examples by category:**

  * **Linear:** Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
  * **Hierarchical:** Trees, Tries
  * **Networked:** Graphs
  * **Hashed:** Hash Tables, Hash Maps

üîπ **Practical Note:** The choice of data structure can make or break system performance. For example:

* A search engine index uses **Tries** or **B-Trees** instead of arrays for fast text lookups.
* A messaging app uses **Queues** for message ordering and delivery.

---

### **Algorithms**

* **Definition:** A **finite, well-defined sequence of steps** designed to transform input into desired output, often leveraging suitable data structures.

* **Qualities of a good algorithm:**

  * **Correctness** ‚Äì Produces accurate results.
  * **Efficiency** ‚Äì Low time and space complexity.
  * **Scalability** ‚Äì Works even when input size grows (important in Big Tech).

* **Examples:**

  * Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort
  * Searching: Binary Search, BFS, DFS
  * Optimization: Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path, Dynamic Programming

üîπ **Practical Note:**

* Interviewers test not only if you can code an algorithm, but if you can **choose the optimal one for given constraints** (time vs. space vs. scalability).

## 2. Extended Terminologies

### **Database**

* **Definition:** Organized collection of persistent information stored on **secondary storage (HDD/SSD)**, optimized for read, write, and update operations.
* **Examples:**

  * **Relational:** MySQL, PostgreSQL (structured data, SQL queries).
  * **NoSQL:** MongoDB, Cassandra (semi-structured/unstructured data, flexible schema).

üîπ **Practical Note:**
A database is about **long-term data durability**; data structures are about **short-term efficiency in RAM**.

---

### **Data Warehouse**

* **Definition:** Specialized system for storing and analyzing **historical and large-scale data**, separated from real-time transactional databases.
* **Use case:** Business intelligence, trend analysis, reporting.
* **Tools:** Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery.

üîπ **Practical Note:**
Warehousing is used for **batch analytics** (quarterly sales reports), not real-time app logic.

---

### **Big Data**

* **Definition:** Extremely large or complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of traditional databases to process.

* **3Vs of Big Data:**

  * **Volume** ‚Äì Terabytes ‚Üí Petabytes
  * **Velocity** ‚Äì High-speed incoming streams (IoT, clickstreams).
  * **Variety** ‚Äì Text, images, logs, audio, video.

* **Ecosystem Tools:** Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Flink.

üîπ **Practical Note:**
Big Data concepts extend **algorithms + data structures** into **distributed memory and storage systems**.

## 3. Memory Layout of a Program (C as reference model)

When a program runs, the **Operating System (OS)** loads it into RAM. Memory is divided into segments:

1. **Code Segment (Text):** Stores compiled machine instructions. Marked **read-only**.

   * Practical example: Prevents accidentally overwriting function instructions.

2. **Stack:**

   * Stores **function call frames** (arguments, return addresses, local variables).
   * **Automatic memory management** ‚Üí frames are pushed/popped as functions call/return.
   * LIFO nature ensures recursion works seamlessly.

3. **Heap:**

   * Stores dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`, `new`).
   * Manual allocation & deallocation required (in unmanaged languages like C/C++).
   * More flexible than the stack, but slower due to fragmentation.

4. **Data Segment:**

   * **Initialized Data:** Stores global/static variables with initialization.
   * **BSS (Block Started by Symbol):** Stores global/static variables without initialization.

## 4. Memory in Practical Programming

### **Program Execution in RAM**

* Every running application (e.g., Chrome.exe) is loaded into RAM.
* Data structures guide **how memory is allocated, reused, and released** inside that RAM footprint.
* After process termination, OS reclaims all memory ‚Üí but leaks during runtime can still cause crashes.

---

### **Stack in Functions**

* Each function call ‚Üí **new stack frame**.
* Frame includes: return address, parameters, local variables.
* Destroyed automatically on return.

üîπ **Example:** Recursive factorial uses stack frames for each recursive call.

---

### **Heap in Functions**

* Used when memory requirements are unknown at compile time.
* Example: Creating an array of user-defined size from input.
* Persistent until **explicitly freed** (`free()` in C, `delete` in C++).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory Leak**

* **Definition:** Allocated memory that is never released ‚Üí remains occupied until process termination.
* **Causes:**

  * Forgetting to `free()` heap memory.
  * Losing reference to allocated block.
* **Consequences:**

  * Unbounded RAM consumption.
  * Program slowdown or system crash.

üîπ **Practical Note:**
Modern languages like **Java, Python, Go** have **garbage collectors**, but leaks can still happen (e.g., lingering references in global structures).
