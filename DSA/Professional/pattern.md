## Example Usage

- **Sliding Window**: Find longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Binary Search**: Search element in rotated array.
- **DFS/BFS**: Minimum steps in maze, connected islands.
- **Backtracking**: N-Queens, all possible permutations.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Minimum cost path, maximum profit.
- **Greedy**: Earliest finish time scheduling.
- **Union-Find**: How many friend groups (provinces)
- **Heap**: Find Kth largest element.

## Tips

- Pick the pattern by examining constraints and problem type.
- Real-life analogies help recall which approach fits best.

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference for solving many algorithmic problems by pattern recognition and analogy .
