## Banking and Financial Markets: A Risk Management Perspective

**Prof. P. C. Narayan | Week 1**

### 1. Risk–Return Relationship

* Fundamental principle: **“Higher risk → higher expected return; Lower risk → lower return.”**
* **Risk-free assets** (e.g., government securities, treasury bonds):

  * Very low risk
  * Lowest returns
* **High-risk assets** (e.g., high-yield/junk bonds):

  * High default risk
  * Higher expected returns
  * Risk of issuer insolvency and non-payment of interest/principal

---

### 2. Meaning of Risk

* Risk arises when a **decision maker has a view about the future**, but the outcome is uncertain.
* Example:

  * CFO believes **interest rates will fall** or **domestic currency will appreciate**
  * Decisions are made based on this view
  * If correct → profits increase
  * If wrong → firm may incur significant losses

---

### 3. Risk Management

* **Objective:** Protect the downside
* Focuses on **minimizing losses if outcomes are opposite to expectations**
* Example:

  * If CFO expects currency depreciation
  * He hedges against appreciation risk
  * Uses **derivative instruments** such as:

    * Currency futures
    * Currency options

---

## Types of Risks in Financial Markets

### 1. Credit Risk

* Risk of **borrower or bond issuer failing to meet contractual obligations**

---

### 3. Foreign Exchange Risk

* Applies to:

  * Foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities
  * Revenues or costs in foreign currency

---

### 4. Interest Rate Risk

* Risk due to **volatility in interest rates**
* Affects:

  * Capital value
  * Income
* Prominent when **asset–liability maturities are mismatched**
* Key element of **Asset–Liability Management (ALM)**

---

### 5. Market Risk

---

### 6. Operational Risk

  * Forced asset liquidation at discounted prices

---

### 8. Solvency Risk

* Risk of **insufficient capital or net worth**
* Firm unable to absorb:

  * Sharp decline in asset values
  * Mark-to-market losses

---

### 9. Course Roadmap

* Upcoming sessions will cover:

  * Causes
  * Consequences
  * Measurement

## Banking and Financial Markets: A Risk Management Perspective

**Prof. P. C. Narayan | Week 1**

## Overview of Liquidity and Solvency – Part 1

---

### 1. Importance of Liquidity and Solvency

* Liquidity and solvency are **far more critical for banks and financial market entities** than for manufacturing or trading firms.
* Reason:

  * Financial asset companies deal with **financial claims (money, deposits, securities)** rather than physical assets.
  * Cash flow mismatches can arise suddenly and on a large scale.

---

### 2. Meaning of Liquidity

* A firm faces a **liquidity problem** when:

  * **Cash outflows > Cash inflows**
* Applies to both financial asset and real asset companies.

#### Cash Outflows (Financial Asset Companies)

* Disbursement of new loans
* Purchase of bonds and securities
* Interest paid to depositors
* Repayment of maturing deposits

#### Cash Inflows (Financial Asset Companies)

* Fresh customer deposits
* Interest income from loans
* Proceeds from sale of bonds
* Loan repayments from borrowers

---

### 3. Meaning of Solvency

* Solvency refers to the ability of a firm to:

  * **Absorb losses using its net worth**
  * Net worth = **Equity capital + Retained earnings**
* Helps withstand:

  * Sudden erosion in the value of assets

### 4. Liquidity vs Solvency

| Aspect       | Liquidity                                                | Solvency                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Nature       | Short-term                                               | Long-term                  |
| Cause        | Cash flow mismatch                                       | Capital inadequacy         |
| Frequency    | Common, often cyclical                                   | Less frequent, deep-rooted |
| Impact       | Temporary stress                                         | May lead to liquidation    |
| Relationship | Prolonged liquidity issues can lead to solvency problems |                            |

---

### 5. Focus of the Course

* Emphasis on **liquidity and solvency risks in financial asset companies**
* Such entities include:

  * Banks
  * Financial institutions
  * Market intermediaries

---

## 6. Illustrative Balance Sheet Example

### Abridged Balance Sheet (₹ million)

#### Assets

* Cash: 24
* Loans: 96
* Government securities: 15
  **Total Assets = 135**

#### Liabilities & Equity

* Customer deposits: 120
* Equity capital: 15
  **Total Liabilities + Equity = 135**

---

### 7. Liquidity Stress Scenario

* Customers withdraw **₹15 million** of deposits
* Deposits reduce from **120 → 105**

#### Ways to Manage Deposit Outflow:

1. **Use cash reserves**

   * Cash reduces from 24 → 9
2. **Borrow short-term**

   * Raise funds in the money market
3. **Sell liquid securities**

   * Dispose government securities worth 15

---

### 8. Key Lesson in Liquidity Management

A liquidity problem can be effectively managed if the bank:

* Holds **adequate cash reserves**, or
* Owns **highly liquid securities**, or
* Has **credibility and access to short-term borrowing**

➡️ In such cases, liquidity stress **does not threaten the firm’s survival**.
