# **Measures of Central Tendency**

### **Definition**
Measures of central tendency are statistical tools used to identify the **central or typical value** around which other data points cluster in a dataset.
The three most commonly used measures are **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode**.

They help summarize large data sets with a **single representative value**.

## **1. Mean (Arithmetic Average)**

### **Definition**
The **mean** is the arithmetic average of all values in a dataset.
It is calculated by **adding all the observations** and **dividing by the total number of observations**.

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg_black&fg_white&dpi=110&space;\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)


* ( \sum X ) = Sum of all data values
* ( N ) = Number of observations

### **Example**

Dataset: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

[
\text{Mean} = \frac{10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50}{5} = \frac{150}{5} = 30
]

**Interpretation:**
The average (mean) value of this dataset is **30**.

### **When to Use the Mean**

* When data is **continuous** and **normally distributed** (no extreme outliers).
* When **all values** contribute equally to the average.
* Best for **quantitative** data such as test scores, height, weight, or temperature.

### **When Not to Use**

* When there are **outliers** (extremely high or low values), as they can **distort** the mean.
  Example: Mean income can be misleading if a few very rich individuals are included.


## **2. Median (Middle Value)**

### **Definition**
The **median** is the **middle value** of an ordered dataset.
If the number of observations is:

* **Odd**, the median is the middle value.
* **Even**, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### **Example**

Dataset: 5, 10, 15, 20, 100
Ordered data → 5, 10, 15, 20, 100
The middle (3rd) value is **15**, so the **median = 15**.

If dataset: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 100
[
\text{Median} = \frac{15 + 20}{2} = 17.5
]

### **When to Use the Median**

* When data contains **outliers or skewed distributions**.
* When analyzing **income, property prices, or survival times**, where extreme values exist.
* For **ordinal data** (ranked data like satisfaction ratings: poor, fair, good, excellent).

### **When Not to Use**

* When data is **symmetrical** and has **no outliers** — mean would be better.
* When data is **nominal** (no natural order).


## **3. Mode (Most Frequent Value)**

### **Definition**
The **mode** is the value that occurs **most frequently** in a dataset.
A dataset can be:

* **Unimodal** – one mode
* **Bimodal** – two modes
* **Multimodal** – more than two modes

### **Example**

Dataset: 3, 7, 7, 8, 10, 10, 10, 12
The number **10** appears most often → **Mode = 10**

### **When to Use the Mode**

* When data is **categorical or nominal** (e.g., color, brand, gender).
  Example: Most preferred brand = Mode.
* When you want to know the **most common** or **frequent** response.

### **When Not to Use**

* When all values occur with equal frequency (no mode).
* When data is **continuous and spread out** with few repeating values.


## **Comparison and Appropriate Usage**

| **Measure** | **Definition**        | **Example (Data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 100)**              | **When to Use**                                  | **When Not to Use**                        |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Mean**    | Average of all values | (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 100)/5 = **40**                 | For **symmetric** distributions without outliers | When data has **extreme values**           |
| **Median**  | Middle value          | Ordered data → 10, 20, 30, 40, 100 → **Median = 30** | For **skewed** or **ordinal** data               | When data is symmetric and mean works fine |
| **Mode**    | Most frequent value   | If data = 10, 10, 20, 30, 40 → **Mode = 10**         | For **categorical** or **nominal** data          | When all values are unique                 |


## **Illustrative Summary**

| **Type of Data**                         | **Best Measure** | **Reason**                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Salary data with a few very high earners | Median           | Less affected by extreme values         |
| Exam scores of a balanced class          | Mean             | Represents overall performance          |
| Favorite food of students                | Mode             | Categorical data — most common response |


### **In Summary**

* **Mean** → Mathematical average → Best for **normal data**
* **Median** → Middle value → Best for **skewed data or outliers**
* **Mode** → Most frequent → Best for **categorical data**

> Together, these measures provide a **comprehensive understanding of data’s central tendency** and are often used jointly to detect **data skewness** and **distribution shape**.

# 🔢 **Quartiles**

**Quartiles** divide a **sorted dataset** into **four equal parts**, with each part containing **25% of the data**.

They help summarize the distribution and **spot trends or outliers**.

Here are the key quartiles:

| **Quartile** | **Name**        | **Meaning**                                             |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q1**       | First Quartile  | 25% of the data falls **below** this value              |
| **Q2**       | Second Quartile | 50% of the data falls below this (i.e., the **median**) |
| **Q3**       | Third Quartile  | 75% of the data falls **below** this value              |

So:

* **Q1** is the **25th percentile**
* **Q2** is the **50th percentile (median)**
* **Q3** is the **75th percentile**

---

### 📈 **Visual Example of Quartiles in a Sorted Dataset**

Let’s take this **sorted dataset**:

{Data = [5,\ 7,\ 8,\ 10,\ 12,\ 13,\ 14,\ 17,\ 18]


#### Step 1: Find Q2 (Median)

There are 9 values → **Middle value = 5th** → **Q2 = 12**

#### Step 2: Find Q1 (Lower Quartile)

Lower half (before the median): [5, 7, 8, 10]
Q1 = average of 2nd and 3rd values → (7 + 8) / 2 = **7.5**

#### Step 3: Find Q3 (Upper Quartile)

Upper half (after the median): [13, 14, 17, 18]
Q3 = average of 2nd and 3rd values → (14 + 17) / 2 = **15.5**

✅ Now you have:

* Q1 = 7.5
* Q2 = 12
* Q3 = 15.5
* IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 15.5 - 7.5 = **8**


### 💡 **Why Quartiles Matter in Data Analysis**

* **Summarize Data**: Quartiles give a quick picture of how your data is distributed.
* **Detect Skewness**: If Q2 is closer to Q1 than Q3, the data is **right-skewed**, and vice versa.
* **Help Spot Outliers**: As we discussed with IQR, outliers are identified using Q1 and Q3.
* **Used in Box Plots**: Box plots visually represent Q1, Q2, Q3, and outliers.

### 🧠 Summary

* **Quartiles split your data into four equal parts.**
* **Q1, Q2 (median), and Q3** are used to describe data distribution.
* They are essential for calculating **IQR** and identifying **outliers**.
* More **robust** than using just the mean and range, especially with skewed or messy data.


### **Interquartile Range (IQR) – Explained**

The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is a measure of statistical dispersion, or how spread out the values in a dataset are. It focuses on the **middle 50% of the data** and is calculated as:


IQR = Q3 - Q1


Where:

* **Q1 (First Quartile)** is the 25th percentile (the value below which 25% of the data fall),
* **Q3 (Third Quartile)** is the 75th percentile (the value below which 75% of the data fall).


### **Significance of IQR in Data Analysis**

1. **Focuses on the Core Data**:
   IQR ignores the lowest 25% and the highest 25% of values, giving a clearer picture of the spread in the central part of the dataset.

2. **Resistant to Outliers**:
   Because it only considers the middle 50% of the data, the IQR is **not influenced by extreme values or outliers**. This makes it more **robust** than the full range.

3. **Useful in Skewed Distributions**:
   In datasets that are not symmetrically distributed (i.e., skewed), IQR provides a better sense of variability than other measures like standard deviation.


### **IQR and Outliers**

IQR plays a key role in identifying **outliers** in a dataset. A common method for detecting outliers using IQR is:

* **Lower Bound** = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
* **Upper Bound** = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR

Any data point **below the lower bound** or **above the upper bound** is considered a **potential outlier**.


### **Why IQR Might Be Preferred Over Range**

| **Feature** | **Range**                           | **Interquartile Range (IQR)**           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Formula     | Max - Min                           | Q3 - Q1                                 |
| Sensitivity | Highly sensitive to outliers        | Resistant to outliers                   |
| Focus       | Looks at the full dataset           | Focuses on the middle 50%               |
| Usefulness  | Less useful in skewed or noisy data | More reliable in real-world, messy data |

**Summary**:
While **range** shows the total spread of the data, it can be distorted by extreme values. In contrast, **IQR provides a more stable and accurate measure** of variability, especially when data contains **outliers or is skewed**.

Great! Let's break down the **Lower Bound** and **Upper Bound** formulas:


### 📌 **Formulas for Detecting Outliers**

![Detecting Outliers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4216e865-112d-45a4-8076-c2f0e4c71cb2)

These formulas are used to **identify outliers** in a dataset.


### ✅ **What Do These Bounds Represent?**

* **Q1 (First Quartile)**: 25% of data falls below this point.
* **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: 75% of data falls below this point.
* **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: Spread of the middle 50% of the data = Q3 - Q1.

Now, using these bounds:

* Any data point **below the Lower Bound** is considered a **low-end outlier**.
* Any data point **above the Upper Bound** is considered a **high-end outlier**.


### 💡 **Why Multiply by 1.5?**

The factor **1.5** is a standard threshold that statisticians use to detect **moderate outliers**. It’s a balance:

* Not too small — avoids labeling normal variation as outliers.
* Not too large — still catches points that are *unusually far* from the rest of the data.

This is not a strict rule but a **convention**. For detecting **extreme outliers**, sometimes **3 × IQR** is used instead.


### 🧠 **Example**

Suppose you have:

* Q1 = 20
* Q3 = 40
* IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 20

Now calculate the bounds:

[
\text{Lower Bound} = 20 - (1.5 \times 20) = 20 - 30 = -10
]
[
\text{Upper Bound} = 40 + (1.5 \times 20) = 40 + 30 = 70
]

So:

* Any value **< -10** or **> 70** is considered an **outlier**.


### 📊 **Why Is This Useful in Data Analysis?**

* Helps you **clean data** by identifying errors or rare events.
* Makes your analysis more **accurate**, especially when using averages or models.
* Keeps **extreme values** from distorting summaries like the mean or standard deviation.


***
# **Measure of Dispersion**

## **1. Variance (σ² or s²):**

Variance measures how **spread out** the data is from the mean (average).

* **Formula (population variance):**
  [
  \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}
  ]
  Where:

  * ( x_i ) = individual data points
  * ( \mu ) = population mean
  * ( N ) = number of data points

* **Sample variance** uses ( n - 1 ) in the denominator instead of ( N ).

## **2. Standard Deviation (σ or s):**

Standard deviation is the **square root of the variance**. It gives a **measure of spread** in the **same units as the data**.

* **Formula:**
  [
  \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
  ]



### 🎯 **Importance in Data Analysis**

### 🤔 **When to Use**

* Use **variance** when:

  * Working with mathematical/statistical models
  * Needing precise calculations of variability
  * Doing theoretical analysis

* Use **standard deviation** when:

  * Presenting results to non-technical audiences
  * Comparing data spread in same unit as original data
  * Understanding dispersion intuitively


### 📌 **Real-Life Examples**

#### **1. Education:**

* A teacher wants to compare test performance between two classes:

  * Class A: mean = 70, SD = 5
  * Class B: mean = 70, SD = 15
    ➤ Class B has more variability – students are more spread out in performance.

#### **2. Finance:**

* Investors use standard deviation to measure **risk**.

  * A stock with a high standard deviation is more volatile (risky).
  * A stock with low standard deviation is more stable.

#### **3. Manufacturing:**

* In quality control, variance helps assess consistency in product dimensions.

  * High variance = more defect probability.

#### **4. Sports:**

* Analyzing a player’s performance:

  * Low SD in scores → consistent player
  * High SD → sometimes scores high, sometimes very low

# ✅ **What is Skewness?**

**Skewness** is a measure of **asymmetry** in a dataset's distribution.

* It tells you **whether the data leans more to the left or right** of the mean.
* A perfectly symmetrical distribution (like a normal distribution) has **zero skewness**.

---

### 📊 **Types of Skewness & Interpretation**

| Type                                 | Skewness Value | Shape             | Interpretation                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Zero Skewness**                    | = 0            | Symmetrical       | Mean = Median = Mode. Data is evenly distributed.            |
| **Positive Skewness** (Right-Skewed) | > 0            | Tail on the right | Mean > Median. A few **large values** pull the average up.   |
| **Negative Skewness** (Left-Skewed)  | < 0            | Tail on the left  | Mean < Median. A few **small values** pull the average down. |

---

### 🔍 **How to Interpret Skewness Values (with ranges)**

| Skewness Value                   | Interpretation          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Between -0.5 and 0.5             | Approximately symmetric |
| Between -1 and -0.5 or 0.5 and 1 | Moderately skewed       |
| Less than -1 or greater than 1   | Highly skewed           |

---

### 📌 **Real-Life Examples**

#### 1. **Positive Skewness (Right-Skewed):**

* **Income distribution**: Most people earn average wages, but a few very high earners pull the mean up.
* **Example**:
  Salaries: [25k, 30k, 35k, 40k, 120k]
  ➤ Mean is high because of 120k, but most earn 25k–40k.

#### 2. **Negative Skewness (Left-Skewed):**

* **Age of retirement**: Most people retire around 60–65, but a few retire very early.
* **Example**:
  Retirement ages: [40, 60, 62, 64, 65]
  ➤ Mean is pulled down by the person retiring at 40.

#### 3. **Zero Skewness (Symmetrical):**

* **Heights of adults** in a population usually follow a normal distribution with little skewness.

***

# **Kurtosis and Its Types**

**Kurtosis** is a statistical measure that describes the *tailedness* or *sharpness* of the peak of a data distribution. It helps us understand the frequency of extreme values (outliers) compared to a normal distribution.

* **Unlike skewness** (which measures the asymmetry of a distribution), **kurtosis** focuses on the extremity of data points in the tails and the height of the peak.

### Types of Kurtosis:

![Types of Kurtosis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ae90b4b-8e20-4ced-b285-c3231a55d1d0)
---
![Kurtosis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845a5977-79e1-49ad-a754-6db592a57fb4)


1. **Mesokurtic (Normal Distribution)**:

   * **Kurtosis Value**: 3 (same as the normal distribution).
   * **Characteristics**:

     * Features a *moderate peak* and *moderate tails*.
     * Extreme values (outliers) are neither too frequent nor too rare.
   * **Example**: Normal distribution (Bell curve).

2. **Leptokurtic (High Kurtosis)**:

   * **Kurtosis Value**: Greater than 3.
   * **Characteristics**:

     * Has a *higher peak* and *heavier tails*.
     * Indicates more frequent extreme values or outliers.
   * **Example**: Stock market returns (where extreme events like market crashes are more common).

3. **Platykurtic (Low Kurtosis)**:

   * **Kurtosis Value**: Less than 3.
   * **Characteristics**:

     * Has a *flatter peak* and *lighter tails*.
     * Extreme values are rare, and the data is more evenly distributed around the mean.
   * **Example**: Uniform distribution or certain discrete distributions.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Kurtosis** helps determine how concentrated the data is around the mean and how much is spread out in the tails.
* It is used to assess the likelihood of extreme events in the data.


# **Measure of Kurtosis**:

A **measure of kurtosis** refers to a specific way of calculating kurtosis based on data, often the **excess kurtosis**. In practice, when you calculate kurtosis, you are finding how much the data deviates from a normal distribution.

* **Excess Kurtosis**: This is the more commonly used version of kurtosis. It is calculated as the kurtosis of the data minus 3 (the kurtosis of a normal distribution). So:

  * **Excess Kurtosis = Kurtosis - 3**.
  * This adjustment allows a normal distribution to have a value of 0 for excess kurtosis.

### In summary:

* **Kurtosis** is the concept or property related to the tails of a distribution.
* **Measure of Kurtosis** is the statistical calculation (like **excess kurtosis**) used to quantify that property.

So, while **kurtosis** describes the tail behavior, **measure of kurtosis** is the actual metric that quantifies it!

Sure! Let's break down **correlation analysis** in a clear and practical way:

---

# ✅ **Correlation Analysis?**

**Correlation analysis** is a statistical method used to measure the **strength and direction of the relationship between two variables**.

* It tells you **whether** and **how strongly** pairs of variables are related.
* The result is a number called the **correlation coefficient**, typically **Pearson’s r**.

---

### 📊 **Correlation Coefficient (r)**

| r value | Strength            | Direction                                     |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| +1      | Perfect correlation | Positive (both variables increase together)   |
| 0       | No correlation      | No relationship                               |
| -1      | Perfect correlation | Negative (one increases, the other decreases) |

#### ✅ Interpretation of r values:

| Range of r                 | Interpretation              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 0.9 to 1.0 or -0.9 to -1.0 | Very strong                 |
| 0.7 to 0.9 or -0.7 to -0.9 | Strong                      |
| 0.5 to 0.7 or -0.5 to -0.7 | Moderate                    |
| 0.3 to 0.5 or -0.3 to -0.5 | Weak                        |
| 0.0 to 0.3 or -0.3 to 0.0  | Very weak or no correlation |

> 📌 **Note**: Correlation does **not** imply **causation**. Just because two things move together doesn’t mean one causes the other.

### 🔍 **Use of Correlation in Data Analysis**

| Purpose                      | Example                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explore relationships**    | Does study time affect exam scores?                                                          |
| **Variable selection**       | In predictive modeling, choose features that correlate with the target variable.             |
| **Data validation**          | Check if two data sources behave similarly.                                                  |
| **Detect multicollinearity** | Avoid using variables that are too strongly correlated with each other in regression models. |

---

### 📌 **Example in Data Analysis (Practical Use)**

Let’s say you're analyzing a dataset of students with the following variables:

* Hours studied
* Exam score
* Sleep hours
* Attendance

You can run correlation analysis to find:

| Variable Pair               | r Value | Interpretation              |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| Hours studied vs Exam score | 0.85    | Strong positive correlation |
| Sleep hours vs Exam score   | 0.2     | Weak correlation            |
| Attendance vs Exam score    | 0.65    | Moderate correlation        |

From this, you might conclude that **study time** is a better predictor of success than **sleep hours** in this context.
