# **Common Statistical Errors to Avoid**

| **Error**                                       | **Description**                                                                                                      | **Example / Notes**                                                                                                                            | **How to Avoid**                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Misinterpreting Statistical Significance** | A statistically significant result (e.g., p-value < 0.05) does **not necessarily mean it is practically important**. | A very small effect can be statistically significant in a large sample, while meaningful effects may not reach significance in a small sample. | Consider **effect size**, **confidence intervals**, and practical relevance alongside p-values.                                  |
| **2. Sampling Bias**                            | Occurs when the **sample is not representative of the population**, leading to invalid conclusions.                  | Online surveys capturing only internet users, missing non-users’ opinions.                                                                     | Use **random or stratified sampling** to ensure representativeness.                                                              |
| **3. Confusing Correlation with Causation**     | **Correlation between two variables does not imply one causes the other**.                                           | Ice cream sales and drowning deaths rise in summer; both are influenced by warm weather, not causation.                                        | Use **controlled experiments**, **longitudinal studies**, or **causal inference methods** to establish causality.                |
| **4. Multiple Testing Without Correction**      | Conducting many hypothesis tests increases the chance of finding **false positives**.                                | Testing dozens of outcomes without adjustment may produce significant results by chance.                                                       | Apply **corrections** like Bonferroni adjustment or **false discovery rate (FDR) control** when performing multiple comparisons. |

### **Summary**

* Statistical errors can **mislead conclusions** and compromise research validity.
* **Awareness and proper methodology** are essential to avoid pitfalls:

  * Consider **practical significance** alongside statistical significance.
  * Ensure **representative sampling**.
  * Distinguish between **correlation and causation**.
  * Correct for **multiple comparisons** when testing several hypotheses.

# **Types of Statistics:**

## **1. Descriptive Statistics**

**Definition**
Descriptive statistics are statistical methods used to **summarize, organize, and describe the characteristics** of a given dataset.
They help transform raw data into meaningful information that can be easily understood and interpreted.

### **Purpose**
* To present data in a **simplified** and **interpretable** form.
* To identify patterns, trends, or central tendencies within a dataset.
* To provide an initial understanding before applying inferential analysis.

### **Common Measures and Tools**

| **Type**                                 | **Description**                                                | **Examples**                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Measures of Central Tendency**         | Indicate the **average or typical value** of a dataset.        | Mean, Median, Mode                            |
| **Measures of Dispersion (Variability)** | Indicate **how spread out** the data values are.               | Range, Variance, Standard Deviation           |
| **Measures of Position**                 | Indicate the **relative standing** of values within a dataset. | Percentiles, Quartiles                        |
| **Graphical Methods**                    | Visually represent data for better understanding.              | Bar charts, Pie charts, Histograms, Box plots |

### **Example**
Suppose you collect the exam scores of 100 students.
Descriptive statistics can summarize the data as:

* Mean (average score) = 75
* Median = 78
* Standard Deviation = 8
* Graphical summary through a histogram showing the distribution of marks.

**Interpretation:** Most students scored around 75–78, and the variation among scores is moderate.


## **2. Inferential Statistics**

### **Definition**
Inferential statistics involve methods that allow researchers to **make generalizations, predictions, or decisions** about a **population** based on data obtained from a **sample**.
It bridges the gap between what is known (sample data) and what is unknown (population characteristics).

### **Purpose**
The main goal of inferential statistics is to:

* **Estimate population parameters** (e.g., population mean, proportion)
* **Test hypotheses** about relationships or differences among variables
* **Predict outcomes** or future values based on sample information

### **Key Techniques in Inferential Statistics**

| **Technique**            | **Description**                                                                                                                        | **Example / Use Case**                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hypothesis Testing**   | A formal procedure to test assumptions or claims about a population using sample data.                                                 | Testing whether a new teaching method improves student performance. |
| **Confidence Intervals** | Provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). | Estimating the average height of students in a college.             |
| **Regression Analysis**  | Examines relationships between variables and makes predictions about one variable based on another.                                    | Predicting sales based on advertising expenditure.                  |


### **Common Techniques**
| **Technique**                    | **Description**                                                                         | **Example Use Case**                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hypothesis Testing**           | Used to determine whether a statement about a population parameter is true or false.    | Testing if a new teaching method improves performance.           |
| **Confidence Intervals**         | Provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. | Estimating the average height of students in a university.       |
| **Regression Analysis**          | Examines relationships between variables and predicts future outcomes.                  | Predicting sales based on advertising expenditure.               |
| **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** | Tests differences among group means.                                                    | Comparing mean scores of students across three teaching methods. |

### **Example**
If a researcher collects data from 200 students (sample) to predict the average IQ of all students in the university (population), inferential statistics helps **estimate** that value and **test hypotheses** like “male and female students have the same average IQ.”

# **Types of Data and Variables**

Understanding the **nature of your data** is essential for choosing the **right statistical methods** and interpreting results accurately.
Broadly, data can be classified into **Quantitative (Numerical)** and **Qualitative (Categorical)** types.

## **1. Quantitative (Numerical) Data**

These data represent **measurable quantities** or **numeric values**.
They can be further divided into two types:

### **A. Discrete Data**

* **Definition:** Countable values; often whole numbers that cannot take fractional parts.
* **Examples:**

  * Number of children in a family
  * Count of customer complaints
  * Number of errors in a document
* **Characteristics:**

  * Arise from counting processes
  * Possible values are finite or countably infinite


### **B. Continuous Data**

* **Definition:** Measurable values that can take **any value within a given range**.
* **Examples:**

  * Height, weight, temperature
  * Time to complete a task
  * Concentration of a chemical
* **Characteristics:**

  * Arise from measurement processes
  * Can take infinitely many values within an interval

## **2. Qualitative (Categorical) Data**

These data represent **categories, qualities, or characteristics** rather than numbers.
They describe attributes that can be **named** or **ranked**.

### **A. Nominal Data**

* **Definition:** Data that represent **named categories** with **no inherent order or ranking**.
* **Examples:**

  * Blood types (A, B, AB, O)
  * Gender (Male, Female, Other)
  * Brand preferences (Nike, Adidas, Puma)
* **Characteristics:**

  * Labels or names identify categories
  * Only equality comparisons are meaningful


### **B. Ordinal Data**

* **Definition:** Data that represent **categories with a meaningful order or ranking**, but **differences between ranks are not equal**.
* **Examples:**

  * Education levels (High school, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)
  * Customer satisfaction (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
  * Pain intensity (Mild, Moderate, Severe)
* **Characteristics:**

  * Rank order is meaningful
  * Interval between categories is not uniform or quantifiable

## **Summary Table**

| **Type**         | **Subtype** | **Nature**         | **Examples**                  | **Order Exists?** | **Numeric?** |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Quantitative** | Discrete    | Countable          | No. of children, complaints   | Yes               | Yes          |
|                  | Continuous  | Measurable         | Height, time, weight          | Yes               | Yes          |
| **Qualitative**  | Nominal     | Named categories   | Gender, blood type            | No                | No           |
|                  | Ordinal     | Ordered categories | Education level, satisfaction | Yes               | No           |

***

# **Scales of Measurement**

Different types of data require different statistical approaches.
Understanding **measurement scales** is essential because it determines **which statistical methods and analyses** can be appropriately applied.


## **1. Nominal Scale**

* **Definition:**
  Represents **categories** or **labels** with **no meaningful order** or **numerical value**.
  Each value simply identifies a distinct category.

* **Examples:**

  * Hair color (Black, Brown, Blonde)
  * Ethnicity (Asian, African, European)
  * Political affiliation (Democrat, Republican, Independent)

* **Statistical Operations Possible:**

  * Frequency distribution (counts)
  * Mode (most frequent category)

* **Limitations:**

  * Mean and median are **not meaningful**
  * No logical ordering among values

* **Use Case:**
  Useful for **classification** and **categorical comparisons**.


## **2. Ordinal Scale**

* **Definition:**
  Represents **categories with a meaningful order or ranking**, but the **intervals between ranks are not consistent or known**.

* **Examples:**

  * Educational level (High school, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)
  * Customer satisfaction (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
  * Pain level (Mild, Moderate, Severe)

* **Statistical Operations Possible:**

  * Median and percentiles
  * Rank-order correlation

* **Limitations:**

  * Differences between ranks cannot be precisely measured
  * Mean calculation is **technically invalid**

* **Use Case:**
  Useful for **ranking preferences**, **ratings**, or **ordered categories**.


## **3. Interval Scale**

* **Definition:**
  A **numerical scale** where **intervals between values are equal**, but there is **no true zero point**.
  Zero is arbitrary and does not represent the absence of the attribute.

* **Examples:**

  * Temperature (°C or °F)
  * Calendar years (2000, 2001, 2002...)
  * IQ scores

* **Statistical Operations Possible:**

  * Mean, median, mode
  * Range, variance, standard deviation

* **Limitations:**

  * Ratios are **not meaningful** (e.g., 70°F is **not twice as hot** as 35°F)

* **Use Case:**
  Useful when **differences** between values matter, but **true zero** is irrelevant.


## **4. Ratio Scale**

* **Definition:**
  A **numerical scale** with **equal intervals** and a **true zero point** that indicates the **absence** of the measured property.
  Allows for **all mathematical and statistical operations**.

* **Examples:**

  * Height, weight, time, money, age, counts

* **Statistical Operations Possible:**

  * All: mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, and ratios

* **Properties:**

  * True zero exists (e.g., 0 kg = no weight)
  * Ratios are meaningful (e.g., 200 pounds is **twice as heavy** as 100 pounds)

* **Use Case:**
  Common in **scientific and quantitative research** requiring precise measurement and comparison.


## **Scale Hierarchy Summary**

| **Scale Type** | **Nature**  | **Order?** | **Equal Intervals?** | **True Zero?** | **Examples**                   | **Statistical Operations** |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Nominal**    | Categorical | ❌          | ❌                    | ❌              | Gender, blood type             | Mode, frequency            |
| **Ordinal**    | Ranked      | ✅          | ❌                    | ❌              | Satisfaction levels, education | Median, percentiles        |
| **Interval**   | Numeric     | ✅          | ✅                    | ❌              | Temperature (°C), IQ           | Mean, SD, correlation      |
| **Ratio**      | Numeric     | ✅          | ✅                    | ✅              | Height, weight, time           | All statistical tests      |


✅ **Key Insight:**
As you move **up the hierarchy** from **Nominal → Ordinal → Interval → Ratio**,
**more statistical operations become valid and meaningful**.

# **Population and Sample**

### **Population**
* The **entire set of individuals, items, or data points** that a researcher wants to study or draw conclusions about.
* Represented by parameters such as population mean (μ) and population standard deviation (σ).

**Example:**
All the students in a university form the population when studying student performance.

### **Sample**
* A **subset of the population** that is selected for actual data collection and analysis.
* Represented by statistics such as sample mean (x̄) and sample standard deviation (s).
* Used because studying the entire population is often impractical, costly, or time-consuming.
  
> A well-designed sampling method ensures that conclusions drawn from the sample can be **generalized** to the entire population with **reasonable accuracy and confidence**.

**Example:**
If 200 students are selected from the university to represent the entire student body, those 200 students form the sample.

### **Relationship Between Population and Sample**
| **Aspect**                        | **Population**                         | **Sample**                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Size**                          | Usually large or infinite              | Smaller, manageable subset  |
| **Symbol for Mean**               | μ (mu)                                 | x̄ (x-bar)                  |
| **Symbol for Standard Deviation** | σ (sigma)                              | s                           |
| **Purpose**                       | The target group we want to know about | The group we actually study |
| **Analysis Type**                 | True parameters (unknown)              | Sample statistics (known)   |

**Goal of inferential statistics:**

> Use **sample data** to make **valid inferences** about the **population**.
