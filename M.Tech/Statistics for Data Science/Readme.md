# **Statistics**

**Statistics** is the branch of mathematics that deals with **collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data** to make informed decisions.
It provides methods to summarize large amounts of data in a meaningful way and to draw conclusions or make predictions based on that data.

In simple terms:

> **Statistics is the science of learning from data.**
> > Statistics helps transform **data** into **insight** and **decision-making power**.

# **Types of Statistics:**

## **1. Descriptive Statistics**

**Definition**
Descriptive statistics are statistical methods used to **summarize, organize, and describe the characteristics** of a given dataset.
They help transform raw data into meaningful information that can be easily understood and interpreted.

### **Purpose**
* To present data in a **simplified** and **interpretable** form.
* To identify patterns, trends, or central tendencies within a dataset.
* To provide an initial understanding before applying inferential analysis.

### **Common Measures and Tools**

| **Type**                                 | **Description**                                                | **Examples**                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Measures of Central Tendency**         | Indicate the **average or typical value** of a dataset.        | Mean, Median, Mode                            |
| **Measures of Dispersion (Variability)** | Indicate **how spread out** the data values are.               | Range, Variance, Standard Deviation           |
| **Measures of Position**                 | Indicate the **relative standing** of values within a dataset. | Percentiles, Quartiles                        |
| **Graphical Methods**                    | Visually represent data for better understanding.              | Bar charts, Pie charts, Histograms, Box plots |

### **Example**
Suppose you collect the exam scores of 100 students.
Descriptive statistics can summarize the data as:

* Mean (average score) = 75
* Median = 78
* Standard Deviation = 8
* Graphical summary through a histogram showing the distribution of marks.

**Interpretation:** Most students scored around 75–78, and the variation among scores is moderate.


## **2. Inferential Statistics**

### **Definition**
Inferential statistics involve methods that allow researchers to **make generalizations, predictions, or decisions** about a **population** based on data obtained from a **sample**.
It bridges the gap between what is known (sample data) and what is unknown (population characteristics).

### **Purpose**
* To test hypotheses or theories.
* To estimate population parameters from sample statistics.
* To determine relationships or differences among variables.

### **Common Techniques**
| **Technique**                    | **Description**                                                                         | **Example Use Case**                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hypothesis Testing**           | Used to determine whether a statement about a population parameter is true or false.    | Testing if a new teaching method improves performance.           |
| **Confidence Intervals**         | Provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. | Estimating the average height of students in a university.       |
| **Regression Analysis**          | Examines relationships between variables and predicts future outcomes.                  | Predicting sales based on advertising expenditure.               |
| **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** | Tests differences among group means.                                                    | Comparing mean scores of students across three teaching methods. |

### **Example**
If a researcher collects data from 200 students (sample) to predict the average IQ of all students in the university (population), inferential statistics helps **estimate** that value and **test hypotheses** like “male and female students have the same average IQ.”


# **Population and Sample**

### **Population**
* The **entire set of individuals, items, or data points** that a researcher wants to study or draw conclusions about.
* Represented by parameters such as population mean (μ) and population standard deviation (σ).

**Example:**
All the students in a university form the population when studying student performance.

### **Sample**
* A **subset of the population** that is selected for actual data collection and analysis.
* Represented by statistics such as sample mean (x̄) and sample standard deviation (s).
* Used because studying the entire population is often impractical, costly, or time-consuming.

**Example:**
If 200 students are selected from the university to represent the entire student body, those 200 students form the sample.

### **Relationship Between Population and Sample**
| **Aspect**                        | **Population**                         | **Sample**                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Size**                          | Usually large or infinite              | Smaller, manageable subset  |
| **Symbol for Mean**               | μ (mu)                                 | x̄ (x-bar)                  |
| **Symbol for Standard Deviation** | σ (sigma)                              | s                           |
| **Purpose**                       | The target group we want to know about | The group we actually study |
| **Analysis Type**                 | True parameters (unknown)              | Sample statistics (known)   |

**Goal of inferential statistics:**

> Use **sample data** to make **valid inferences** about the **population**.


### **In Summary**

| **Type**                   | **Purpose**                              | **Focus**                       | **Example**                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive Statistics** | To describe and summarize data           | Data we already have            | Average marks of students in your class                    |
| **Inferential Statistics** | To draw conclusions and make predictions | Data we don’t have (population) | Predicting average marks of all students in the university |
