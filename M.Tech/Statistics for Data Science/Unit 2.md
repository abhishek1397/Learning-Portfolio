The statement:

#### **"If two events are mutually exclusive, then they have to be dependent and not independent"**

is **correct** â€” here's why:

### ðŸ”¹ Definitions:

* **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are *mutually exclusive* if they **cannot occur at the same time**.

  * Example: When flipping a coin, the events "heads" and "tails" are mutually exclusive.

* **Independent Events**: Two events are *independent* if the occurrence of one **does not affect** the probability of the other.

  * Mathematically:
    [
    P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
    ]

### ðŸ”¸ Why Mutually Exclusive Events Are **Not Independent**:

If events ( A ) and ( B ) are mutually exclusive:

* ( P(A \cap B) = 0 ) (because they cannot both happen)

If they were also independent, then:

* ( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) )

So, if both were true:
[
P(A) \cdot P(B) = 0
\Rightarrow \text{At least one of } P(A) \text{ or } P(B) = 0
]

This means: **Mutually exclusive events can only be independent if at least one of them has zero probability**, which is trivial and not interesting in most real-world situations.

### âœ… Therefore:

* If two events are **mutually exclusive** and both have **non-zero probabilities**, they are **always dependent**.
* So the statement is **true**:

  > Mutually exclusive events are dependent (unless one has probability zero).
