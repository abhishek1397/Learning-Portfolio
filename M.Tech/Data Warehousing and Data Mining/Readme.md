# Data Warehousing

#### **Purpose:** 
  Centralized repository to collect data from various sources for better management and decision-making.
  
#### **Importance:** 
  Helps organizations store large amounts of data efficiently and extract important insights to support growth and decisions.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Definition and characteristics of a data warehouse.
  - Difference between OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).

- **Architecture:**
  - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process gathers data from multiple sources.
  - OLAP operations: slicing, dicing, roll-up, drill-down, pivot, etc., for data analysis and visualization.

- **Data Models:**
  - Star schema and Snowflake schema for organizing data.
  - Fact tables and dimension tables play crucial roles.

- **Additional Terms:**
  - Metadata management.
  - Data marts and data lakes and their differences.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Cleaning, normalization, data reduction, compression to prepare data for mining or machine learning.

- **Applications:** Used in diverse domains like healthcare, banking, finance, telecommunications, etc.

# Data Mining

#### **Purpose:** 
  Use mining techniques on data warehouse or big data to find hidden patterns, facts for decision-making.

#### **Relation to Machine Learning:** 
  Overlaps with ML and statistical methods.

- **Key Topics:**
  - Importance and types of data mining.
  - Preprocessing steps such as cleaning, normalization, compression, and noise removal before mining.

- **Techniques:**
  - Classification (Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM).
  - Clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN).
  - Regression (Linear regression, Logistic regression).
  - Association rule mining including Apriori and FP-growth algorithms.

- **Other Topics:**
  - Outlier detection using distance-based (k-NN) and density-based (DBSCAN) methods.

- **Applications:**
  - Pattern detection for diseases in healthcare.
  - Credit scoring in banking.
  - Customer retention and recommendation in telecom and OTT platforms.
