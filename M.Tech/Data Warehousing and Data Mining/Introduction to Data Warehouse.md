## Introduction to Data Warehouse

![Data Warehousing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3402e951-bb54-48ca-96dc-e3ac3de33a14)

### What is a Data Warehouse?
- A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized storage repository where large amounts of data from multiple sources is collected, stored and processed to extract meaningful insights to help grow and improve business.
- sources such as operational databases, business applications, and external systems.
- Enables businesses to integrate and harmonize data to create a single source of truth for analysis and reporting purposes
- Supports business intelligence, analytics, and decision-making by allowing efficient trend analysis, reporting, and querying over large volumes of historical data
- Stores both current and historical data to help organizations derive insights, predict future trends, and make informed decisions
- It is similar to a physical warehouse (like a potato warehouse) where produce is gathered from multiple locations and stored before use or distribution. 

### ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Data is first **extracted** from multiple, diverse sources (such as different operational systems or databases).
- Then, it is **transformed** and integrated into a consistent format (data cleaning, removing noise).
- Finally, the data is **loaded** into the warehouse for storage and further analysis.

### Data Processing and Models
- After loading, data undergoes cleaning and processing to remove meaningless or erroneous information.
- The structured data in the warehouse is organized using models like the **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.
- Specialized tools by companies like Oracle and Microsoft (e.g., Oracle Data Integrator, Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services) help handle ETL and data integration processes.

### Practical Examples and Analogies
- The concept is analogous to a farmer bringing potatoes from various fields to one large warehouse for storage.
- Large companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) build vast physical warehouses, while smaller companies leverage cloud solutions like Google BigQuery to manage data storage efficiently.

### Data Usage and Business Intelligence
- Once stored and cleaned, data can be mined using tools like Python, R, and visualization software (Power BI, Tableau) to generate **business intelligence** insights.
- These insights help in making data-driven decisions, optimize business strategies, and foster business growth.
- Data mining cannot be performed unless data is first accumulated and stored in a warehouse.

### Challenges and Considerations
- Building and maintaining a physical warehouse comes with challenges like managing hardware infrastructure (routers, switches, storage disks).
- Environmental issues such as controlling humidity and temperature are critical for physical warehouses.
- Cloud-based data warehousing offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative for smaller organizations.

# "Lec - 4:  Star Schema in Data Warehousing"

### Overview
The Star Schema is a fundamental data modeling technique used in data warehouses to organize data for efficient querying and analysis. It features a simple, intuitive structure with a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables, resembling a star's shape. This design is optimized for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and business intelligence.

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240730100256/imgonline-com-ua-resize-7FChpPp58PUg2cZf.jpg" >

### Components of Star Schema

#### Fact Table
- Located at the center of the schema.
- Stores **quantitative data** or measures (e.g., sales amount, quantity sold, profit).
- Each record represents a specific event or transaction (e.g., a sale).
- Contains foreign keys referencing dimension tables.

#### Dimension Tables
- Surround the fact table like points of a star.
- Hold **descriptive attributes** or context about the facts (e.g., product name, customer info, date, location).
- Enable slicing and dicing of data for multiple analysis perspectives.
- Connected to the fact table via primary key to foreign key relationships.

### How It Works
- Users query the fact table to retrieve metrics.
- Dimension tables provide context, enabling queries like total sales by product category, region, or time period.
- The schema minimizes complex joins due to straightforward connections between fact and dimension tables.

### Example Scenario: Retail Sales Analysis
- Fact table stores transactional data such as transaction ID, product ID, customer ID, date, sales amount, quantity, and profit.
- Dimension tables provide product details (name, category, size), customer information (name, location, contact), and date components (day, month, year).
- Analysts can generate reports like "Total shoe sales in Toronto in November" by joining the fact table to relevant dimension tables with minimal complexity.


### Advantages of Star Schema

| Aspect                    | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplicity**             | Easy to understand and navigate; intuitive layout encourages effective self-service analytics. |
| **Query Performance**      | Minimal joins and clear join paths improve query speed, especially for aggregation queries.  |
| **Referential Integrity**  | Built-in through strong primary-foreign key relationships between dimension and fact tables. |
| **Maintenance & Loading**  | Efficient data loading via batch processing; dimension tables updated less frequently than fact tables. |
| **Flexibility & Scalability** | Easy to extend by adding new dimensions or facts without disrupting existing schema.           |
| **Business Reporting**     | Simplifies business reporting and period-over-period comparisons due to organized layout.    |


### Best Practices for Implementation

- **Choose the Right Granularity:** Define the level of detail for the fact table aligned with business needsâ€”detailed granularity provides richer insights but increases data volume.
- **Normalize Dimensions Judiciously:** Keep dimension tables denormalized for performance but consider normalization to reduce data redundancy if dimensions become large or complex.
- **Maintain Consistent Keys:** Use surrogate keys for dimension tables to maintain data integrity and ensure consistent joins.
- **Optimize for Query Patterns:** Design schema based on common queries to minimize joins and support fast filtering and aggregation.
- **Automate and Document Schema Changes:** Keep the schema flexible for changes in business requirements and ensure proper documentation for maintainability.
- **Use Robust Data Warehousing Platforms:** Select platforms (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse, Databricks) that efficiently handle star schemas and large datasets.

### Summary
The Star Schema offers a straightforward and powerful method for modeling data warehouses. It enhances query performance, simplifies reporting, and supports scalable and flexible analytics. By adhering to best practices, organizations can maximize the benefits of star schema designs for robust business intelligence and decision support.

### Relationship Between Star Schema and Data Structures

#### Star Schema (Logical Design)
 **star schema** defines how data is **logically related and structured** for analytical processing. This logical model is optimized for querying and reporting in data warehouses.

#### Data Structures (Physical Implementation)
**Data structures** define how this schema is **implemented physically** in memory or on disk. They influence performance, storage, and query efficiency.

Examples include:

- **B-trees** for indexing fact and dimension tables.
- Data stored in **columnar formats**, **arrays**, or **hash tables** to optimize read performance.
- SQL joins implemented using algorithms like **hash joins** or **graph traversal**, which rely on appropriate data structures.

### Summary

While the **star schema** provides a logical blueprint for organizing data, **data structures** are the foundational tools that enable efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of that data.

# "Lec - 5: Snowflake Schema in Data Warehousing "

### Overview
The Snowflake Schema is a variation of the Star Schema used in data warehouses. It introduces **normalization** to dimension tables, breaking them into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

![Snowflake Schema](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250212185011691000/Snowflake-Schema-660.webp)

### Detailed Explanation

#### Star Schema
- Prioritizes **query speed and simplicity**.
- Dimension tables are denormalized for **faster joins** and **simpler queries**.
- Best suited to environments requiring **quick, ad-hoc reporting** and **dashboarding**.
- Denormalization leads to **data redundancy** and **potential inconsistencies** but simplifies analysis.
- Ideal for **smaller to mid-sized datasets** with relatively flat hierarchies.

#### Snowflake Schema
- Focuses on **data normalization** to improve **storage efficiency** and **data integrity**.
- Dimension tables are split into multiple related tables to **remove redundancy**.
- Suitable for large and complex data warehouses with **deep hierarchies**.
- Query performance can be slower due to additional joins but modern cloud warehouses optimize this well.
- Easier to maintain and update because changes propagate without duplication error risk.
- Fits **regulated industries** and **organizations requiring rigorous data governance**.


### Difference Between Star and Snowflake Schema

| Feature                 | Star Schema                                      | Snowflake Schema                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**           | Central fact table with denormalized dimension tables forming a star-like shape | Central fact table with normalized dimension tables split into multiple related sub-tables forming a snowflake shape |
| **Data Normalization**  | Denormalized dimension tables (redundant data)  | Normalized dimension tables (minimizes redundancy) |
| **Query Complexity**    | Simple queries with fewer joins                   | Complex queries with multiple joins across tables |
| **Query Performance**   | Faster due to fewer joins                         | Slower due to additional joins                     |
| **Storage Requirements**| Uses more storage due to data redundancy         | Uses less storage by reducing duplication          |
| **Data Integrity**      | Lower because of redundancy leading to potential anomalies | Higher due to enforced referential integrity       |
| **Design Complexity**   | Simple to design and understand                   | More complex design and maintenance                 |
| **Maintenance**         | Easier to maintain due to simplicity             | More effort needed due to normalized structures     |
| **Scalability**         | Scalable for query speed and ad-hoc reporting   | Scalable for complex hierarchies and data integrity |
| **Use Cases**           | Best for quick analytics, small to medium datasets, simple hierarchy | Best for large datasets with complex hierarchies and frequent updates |


### How Snowflake Schema Works

- The fact table remains central with quantitative data (e.g., sales amounts, quantity, profit).
- Dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. For example, a Customer dimension is split into Customer and Location tables.
- Primary keys in dimension tables are referenced as foreign keys in other related dimension tables or in the fact table.
- This structure maintains referential integrity and reduces data duplication.


### Example Scenario

- In a star schema, a Customer dimension may include customer ID, name, location ID, city, and state all in one table.
- In the snowflake schema, the same would be split into a Customer table (ID, name, location ID) and a separate Location table (location ID, city, state).
- Updates such as changing a city name (e.g., Jaipur to Jeypur) need to be made only once in the Location table, simplifying maintenance.
- Queries require more joins to combine data from multiple normalized tables, which may affect performance.


### Advantages of Snowflake Schema
- **Reduced Data Redundancy:** Normalization minimizes duplicate data storage.
- **Easier Data Maintenance:** Updates to shared attributes (like city names) are centralized.
- **Improved Data Integrity:** Normalized structure enforces strict referential integrity.
- **Storage Efficiency:** Less disk space required compared to denormalized star schema.

### Disadvantages of Snowflake Schema
- **Complex Queries:** Increased number of joins makes querying more complex.
- **Slower Query Performance:** Joins on multiple tables may degrade performance.
- **Implementation Complexity:** More sophisticated to design and manage than star schema.

### Choosing the Right Schema

- **Choose Star Schema if:**
  - Fast query performance and simplicity are priorities.
  - Dataset has fewer dimensions with low hierarchy levels.
  - Storage space is less constrained.
  - Users require easy-to-understand schema for quick insights.

- **Choose Snowflake Schema if:**
  - Data integrity and minimizing redundancy are critical.
  - Dataset involves complex hierarchical relationships or many-to-many mappings.
  - Storage efficiency is important due to large-scale data volume.
  - Maintenance and update flexibility are priorities.
  - Compliance and auditability are required.

### Modern Trends and Hybrid Approaches
- Cloud data platforms (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) use optimization techniques (join elimination, caching) to narrow the performance gap between snowflake and star schemas.
- Many real-world implementations use **hybrid approaches** (sometimes called starflake), combining denormalized and normalized structures to balance performance and maintainability.
- The choice depends heavily on specific organizational needs, data characteristics, and platform capabilities.
  
### Summary
The Snowflake Schema is a normalized extension of the Star Schema designed to address data redundancy and maintenance challenges by splitting dimension tables into related sub-tables. While it offers improved data integrity and storage optimization, it introduces complexity in query writing and potential performance trade-offs. The choice between star and snowflake schemas depends on the specific needs for query speed versus data maintenance and storage efficiency.

# "Lec - 6: OLTP | Online Transaction Processing "

### What is OLTP?
- OLTP stands for **Online Transaction Processing**.
- It manages **transaction-oriented applications**, usually for data entry and retrieval transactions.
- Examples include buying a product on Amazon, paying fees online, booking hotels, or transferring money via apps like Paytm or SBI.
- Essentially, when users perform tasks or transactions online (e.g., searching for items, selecting products, making payments), they are using OLTP systems.
- The focus is on **fast, reliable, and consistent processing** of transactions, such as inserting, updating, or deleting data.

### Components of OLTP System
1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Users interact via desktop or mobile applications.
   - Through the UI, they search products, select items, add them to carts, make payments, etc.
2. **Application Server**
   - The applications run on servers which could be **on-premises** (company's own servers) or **cloud-based** (e.g., Google App Engine, AWS).
   - The server handles the logic of the application.
3. **Database**
   - Stores all data related to transactions.
   - Examples of database software include Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL.
   - The database is where the actual data for products, users, transactions are maintained.
   - Data is created and saved each time a transaction happens, ensuring the business operations continue smoothly.

### Transaction Flow Example
##### from non-tech perspective
- User opens the application (like Amazon).
- Searches and selects products.
- Adds products to the cart and makes payment.
- The transaction data is recorded into the database.

##### from tech perspective
- A user initiates a request (e.g., place an order).
- The UI forwards the request to the application server.
- The application processes business logic, validates data, and initiates a database transaction.
- The database performs the insert/update/delete while maintaining data integrity.
- Upon success, the transaction is committed; if any step fails, it rolls back completely.
  
### Key Characteristics of OLTP Systems
- **High Concurrency**: Supports thousands or millions of simultaneous users performing transactions.
- **Fast Processing**: Transactions are quick and often involve few records.
- **Data Integrity**: Guarantees ACID compliance to prevent partial or incorrect updates.
- **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**: Uses replication and failover mechanisms to ensure availability.
- **Scalability**: Employs techniques like connection pooling, read replicas, and sharding to handle load.

### Importance of Data
- Data is critical for business analysis.
- Though a user may not need old transaction data, companies keep it to analyze buying patterns, sales, profit, loss, and other business metrics.
- This stored transactional data can be later used by **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** systems for reporting and analysis after being stored in data warehouses.

  ### Modern OLTP System Trends
- Support for diverse data types beyond traditional relational formats.
- Integration with streaming platforms (e.g., Kafka) for event capture.
- Use of distributed SQL databases for global scaling with ACID guarantees.
- Coexistence with analytics, search, and big data systems to handle complex workloads.

### Summary
- OLTP systems facilitate the easy and quick performance of business transactions online.
- Every day numerous transactions happen through various platforms.
- The system relies on a tight integration of UI, application servers, and databases working together.
- Transactions generate data that supports both current business operations and future analytical insights.

# "Lec - 8: Normalization in Data Transformation "

## Introduction to Normalization in Data Transformation

- **Normalization** is a technique used in data transformation to bring different features of a dataset onto a common scale, reduce redundancy, and ensure data integrity.
- The goal is to standardize the range of independent variables or features to facilitate consistent and effective data analysis or machine learning.

### Why Normalize?
- Feature values in datasets can vary widely (e.g., square footage in thousands vs. number of bedrooms in single digits).
- Algorithms can be biased by features with larger values; normalization brings all features to a comparable scale.
- Example: Computer standardizes all languages to binary (0,1); similarly, normalization standardizes data features.

### Min-Max Normalization Technique

- **Purpose**: Rescales feature to a fixed range, usually.[1]
- **Formula**: 
![Min-Max](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a72b37aa-d310-43d8-a71e-cf406c605234)
- **Application**: Suitable when minimum and maximum bounds are known and there are no outliers.
- **Example**: House sizes ranging from 1000 to 1800 sq ft can be normalized to  using the formula above.[1]

### Z-score Normalization Technique

- **Purpose**: Standardizes feature by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- **Formula**: 
 ![Z-score](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c75cc875-f3ab-49ae-9a33-5d31eb790f4f)
- **Application**: Best when data is normally distributed.
- **Example**: Feature values like  can be converted to z-scores to understand each valueâ€™s relative position to the mean.

### Key Summary Points

- Use **min-max normalization** for bounded, non-outlier data to scale between 0 and 1.
- Use **z-score normalization** for data where distribution is approximately normal and relative deviation from the mean is important.
- Normalization improves algorithm performance by preventing features with large numeric ranges from dominating model training.


# "Lec - 9: Introduction to Data Discretization "

## Introduction to Data Discretization

- **Data discretization** is a data pre-processing technique used to convert continuous data into discrete categories or bins.
- The main goal is to make raw, continuous data more suitable for machine learning models by organizing it into manageable, interpretable groups.


## Need for Discretization

- Continuous variables (e.g., age, income, temperature) can have infinitely many values.
- Many analytic tasks and ML algorithms perform better or are easier with categorical (discrete) input.
- Discretization enables:
  - Summarization of large, continuous datasets.
  - Identification of patterns across categories.
  - Simplified interpretation and faster modeling.


## Basic Discretization Process

- Convert a range of continuous values into a finite number of **bins** (categories).
- Example (World Population & Age):
  - Age data for 8+ billion people is continuous.
  - Questions like "What percent of people are aged 100+?" or "How many are 20 or younger?" require binning age into groups (e.g., 0â€“20, 21â€“40, etc.).
  - Each bin represents a category, helping with analysis and visualization.

## Common Discretization Techniques
**Techniques**: Equal-width binning, equal-frequency binning, clustering, and custom/decision tree approaches are consistently listed as standard discretization techniques

### 1. Equal-Width Binning

- Divide the entire range of a variable into intervals ("bins") of equal size.
- **Formula for bin width:**

 ![Equal-Width Bin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdf6542b-8b90-4640-a3f0-5ccc7cd54b03)
 
- Assign each value to its corresponding bin based on interval boundaries.
- Example:
  - Age range: 18â€“70, bins: 4
  - Bin width: $$(70-18)/4 = 13$$
  - Bins: 18â€“30, 31â€“43, 44â€“56, 57â€“70

### 2. Other Techniques

- Equal-frequency binning: Each bin has approximately the same number of data points.
- Clustering-based or decision tree methods: Customizable, often based on data distribution.
- Custom binning (domain-specific): Bins created based on business logic or particular criteria.

## Example Workflow (Equal-Width Binning)

1. Identify range and total bins.
2. Calculate bin intervals.
3. Assign each data point to the appropriate bin (e.g., age 21 goes into 18â€“30 bin).
4. Analyze, summarize, or visualize data by bin.

## Summary
- **Data discretization** transforms continuous variables into categorical ones for easier analysis and machine learning.
- Equal-width binning is commonly used, but various methods exist to suit data characteristics and task requirements.
- Enables better insight extraction, statistical summaries, and improved ML model performance when working with continuous features.

# "Lec - 10: Data Preprocessing & Data Cleaning "

## Introduction to Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning

- Data preprocessing is a critical step in data science that involves **cleaning and transforming raw data** into a useful format for analysis.
- The goal is to improve data quality by handling missing values, noise, inconsistencies, and preparing the data for modeling.

## Importance of Data Preprocessing
- Raw data from various sources is often **incomplete, noisy, inconsistent, or inaccurate**.
- Proper preprocessing ensures that machine learning algorithms perform better and yield reliable results.
- Without preprocessing, models may have poor accuracy or produce misleading insights.

## Key Techniques in Data Preprocessing

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Handling missing values**:

# "Lec - 11: ETL vs ELT in Data Warehouse"

# Introduction to ETL and ELT

- ETL stands for **Extract, Transform, Load** â€” a traditional data integration process for data warehouses.
- ELT stands for **Extract, Load, Transform**, a newer approach suited for modern big data and cloud data lakes.


## ETL Process

- Extract data from multiple sources.
- Transform data before loading: clean missing values, remove duplicates, normalize, discretize, and integrate data.
- Load the cleaned and transformed data into the data warehouse.
- Used when transformation is required before storage.
- Common tools: Informatica, Talend, Microsoft SSIS.


## ELT Process

- Extract data from sources.
- Load raw, untransformed data directly into the data lake or warehouse.
- Transform data later on demand based on analysis or business requirements.
- Useful for big data or unstructured data scenarios where upfront transformation causes delays.
- Leverages cloud storage and scalable computing for transformation (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).
- Better suited to handle massive volumes of data with flexibility.

### Key Differences Between ETL and ELT

| Feature                | ETL                                   | ELT                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data transformation    | Before loading into warehouse       | After loading into warehouse/datalake|
| Use case               | Structured data, traditional warehouses | Unstructured/big data, cloud data lakes |
| Data storage           | Transformed/cleaned data only       | Raw + transformed data              |
| Performance impact     | Extract-transform then load delays  | Load raw data fast, transform later |
| Tools                  | Informatica, SSIS, Talend            | Cloud-native tools like BigQuery, Snowflake |
| Data volume suitability| Moderate to large                   | Very large/scalable                 |

### When to Use What

- ETL is preferred when data quality and consistency are important before storage.
- ELT is favored when fast ingestion of all raw data is needed and transformation resources are elastic.
- ELT fits well in cloud-first or big data ecosystems with scalable compute.

### Summary
- ETL and ELT differ mainly by the order of transformation and loading steps.
- ETL transforms before loading to ensure clean data; ELT loads raw data and transforms later.
- The choice depends on data complexity, volume, processing needs, and infrastructure.

# "Lec - 12: Difference Between Data Warehouse, Data Mart, & Data Lake"

![Difference](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/463b5980-8f15-4ed3-84d4-10056d4f2a99)

## Data Warehouse

- A centralized repository where data from multiple locations is:
  - Extracted,
  - Integrated,
  - Cleaned,
  - Transformed (normalized, categorized),
  - And stored in a structured, organized way.
- Supports analysis and reporting for the entire enterprise.
- Example: Mango farm analogy where raw mangoes from different farms are collected, cleaned, categorized, and stored under controlled conditions (AC, shelves) in a warehouse.
- Data here is processed and made ready for business use.

### Data Mart

- A subset of the data warehouse focused on a **specific department or business function**.
- Contains only relevant, processed data for that department.
- Example: From the mango warehouse, a data mart could be only the sales data or marketing data.
- Smaller in size but optimized for specialized queries and faster access.

### Data Lake

- A large storage area (like a huge dump or warehouse) holding **raw, unprocessed (unstructured or semi-structured) data** from multiple sources.
- No pre-processing: data is stored as-is.
- Suitable for big data scenarios, IoT data, logs, sensor data, etc.
- Requires significant storage space and often cloud infrastructure.
- Processing and analysis happen later as per requirement.
- Example: Raw mangoes dumped without sorting or cleaning.

### Key Differences Summarized

| Aspect           | Data Warehouse                                  | Data Mart                                     | Data Lake                                  |

# "Lec - 13: OLAP operations"

## Introduction

- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations help analyze multidimensional data in a data warehouse.
- These operations include Slice, Dice, Roll-up, Drill-down, and Pivot.

### Real-Life Example Setup
- Example: A company sells products like laptops, mobiles, and tablets.
- Sales data is collected across multiple regions and time periods (quarters Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
- This creates a three-dimensional data cube:  
  Dimensions: Product, Region, Quarter.

## OLAP Operations

### 1. Slice
- Selects a single dimension to examine.
- Example: Slice by product 'Laptop' to see total sales for laptops across all regions and quarters.
- Conceptually like cutting a slice from the data cube to focus on one dimension.

### 2. Dice
- Select multiple dimensions with specified values.
- Example: Filter sales data for USA and Canada for Q1 and Q2 and products: Laptop and Mobile.
- Produces a smaller sub-cube with multiple dimensions filtered.

### 3. Roll-Up
- Aggregates data to a higher level.
- Example: Sum sales for all quarters to get yearly sales, or combine India and China to Asia region.
- Moves up the hierarchy for summarized views.

### 4. Drill-Down
- Opposite of Roll-Up; moves to more detailed data.
- Example: From yearly sales to quarterly sales, then monthly sales.
- Allows exploring finer details.

### 5. Pivot (Rotate)
- Reorients the data cube for a different perspective.
- Example: Swap the axis for products and quarters to better visualize data.
- Often used for visualization enhancements.

## Summary
- OLAP operations provide flexible analysis over large multidimensional datasets.
- They enable efficient slicing and dicing of business data to extract insights at different granularities.
- These operations support decision-makers by providing summarized and detailed views of data.

# "Lec - 14: Types of Data"

## Introduction

- Understanding data types is essential for data mining and data warehousing.
- Different algorithms and storage techniques depend on the type of data.
- Data types influence algorithm choice like clustering, classification, regression, etc.


## Types of Data in Data Warehousing

### 1. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)

- Represents categories or labels.
- Non-numeric data.
- Two main types:

  - **Nominal Data**: Categories without any order.
    - Examples: Gender (Male, Female, Others), Blood Group, Colors.
    - Used in classification problems where order does not matter.
  
  - **Ordinal Data**: Categories with a meaningful order but no fixed interval between them.
    - Examples: Education levels (Primary, Secondary, Higher), Ratings (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent).
    - Categories can be ordered but differences are not measurable.


### 2. Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)

- Numeric data where mathematical operations are meaningful.
- Two types:

  - **Discrete Data**: Countable numbers (integers).
  - **Continuous Data**: Can take any value within a range (including fractions and decimals).
    - Example: Age, Temperature, Height.

- Used in regression tasks and numerical analyses.


### 3. Specialized Data Types

- **Time Series Data**: Data indexed by time.
  - Examples: Stock prices, temperature changes recorded every second.
  - Requires forecasting and time-based analysis.

- **Spatial/Geographic Data**:
  - Contains location information (latitude, longitude).
  - Used in GIS systems, customer distribution mapping.

- **Unstructured Data**:
  - Includes text, email, tweets, customer reviews.
  - Requires Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis and other insights.
  
- **Web Data / Clickstream Data**:
  - Tracks online user behavior such as searches, clicks, and interactions.
  - Used in recommendation systems.

- **Sensor / Video Data**:
  - Data from CCTV, motion detection, facial recognition.
  - Used in security and monitoring applications.

### Storage and Processing Implications

- Structured data fits well in SQL databases.
- Unstructured data often stored and processed with NoSQL or specialized big data systems (e.g., HDFS, NoSQL databases).
- Understanding data types helps select appropriate algorithms and storage solutions.

### Summary
- Knowing type of data guides preprocessing, storage, and analysis strategies.
- Data types include qualitative, quantitative, time series, spatial, unstructured, and specialized forms.
- Proper handling of each type enables meaningful insight extraction and efficient data management.

# "Lec - 15: LZW Algorithm"

## Introduction to LZW Algorithm

- LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) is a popular **lossless data compression** technique.
- It reduces file size by replacing repeated sequences of characters with shorter codes.
- Maintains data integrityâ€”original data can be perfectly reconstructed.
- Used extensively in data warehousing and mining to save storage space.


### Why Compression?

- Large datasets require efficient storage and fast transmission.
- Compression reduces file size while preserving all data values.
- Two types of compression:
  - **Lossless compression**: no data loss, used where data integrity is important.
  - **Lossy compression**: some data loss, typically for images/videos where perfect accuracy not critical.


### How LZW Works: Basic Concept

- Builds a **dictionary** of sequences appearing in the data.
- Assigns unique index values (codes) to each unique sequence.
- When a sequence repeats, it is replaced by the code instead of the full sequence.
- Example: For a sequence "ABBA", the dictionary stores "A", "B", "AB", etc., and encodes repeated sequences as shorter codes.


### Encoding Process Steps

1. **Initialize dictionary** with all possible single characters.
2. Read input characters and form sequences.
3. If a sequence is already in the dictionary, continue adding characters.
4. When a sequence is no longer in the dictionary, add it and output the code for the previous sequence.
5. Repeat until all input data is processed.
6. Final encoded output is a series of dictionary index codes representing the original data.


#### Example Walkthrough

- Given a sequence with characters like 'a' and 'b', assign index codes starting from 1, 2, etc.
- Build sequences like "a", "ab", "abb", "abba", assigning new codes as new sequences appear.
- Use codes to represent recurring sequences rather than repeating full strings.
- Encoding ends by adding a final code for the last character.

#### Applications

- Used for compressing image files (GIF, TIFF).
- Used in data warehouses to reduce storage requirements.
- Maintains fast compression and decompression, ensuring data retrieval accuracy.

# "Lec - 1&: What is Sampling and Its types"

## Introduction to Sampling

- Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a large population to estimate or analyze characteristics of the entire population.
- Useful to save time and resources when working with large datasets.

## Real-Life Example

- Election exit polls use sampling to predict which party or candidate will win without surveying the entire population.


## Types of Sampling Techniques

### 1. Simple Random Sampling

- Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- Can be done with replacement (sampled individuals can be selected again) or without replacement.
- Example: Randomly picking student roll numbers from a list.

### 2. Stratified Random Sampling

- The population is divided into homogeneous groups called strata.
- Samples are drawn randomly from each stratum.
- Ensures each subgroup is adequately represented.
- Example: Dividing students by class (9th, 10th, 11th grade) and sampling from each class.

### 3. Cluster Random Sampling

- The population is divided into clusters, which are heterogeneous internally.
- Entire clusters are randomly selected.
- Useful for very large or spread-out populations.
- Example: Selecting certain schools as clusters and analyzing all students in those schools.

### 4. Systematic Random Sampling

- Selects samples at regular intervals from an ordered list, starting at a random point.
- Example: Selecting every 4th student starting from roll number 2.

## Summary

- Sampling reduces the data size for efficient processing without significant loss of information.
- Choice of sampling method depends on data structure and analysis objectives.
- Sampling is vital in data preprocessing, mining, and warehousing.
