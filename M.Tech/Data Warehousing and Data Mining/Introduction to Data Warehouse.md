# "Lec - 1: Introduction to Data Warehouse with Examples"

## Introduction to Data Warehouse

- A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized storage repository where data from multiple sources is collected and stored. It serves as a large storage area for data that can later be processed and used for business insights and decision-making.

  - Real-world analogy: Like a potato warehouse where farmers bring potatoes from various locations, data from diverse sources is gathered and stored in one place.

- **ETL Process** (Extract, Transform, Load) is a crucial step:
  - Extract data from various sources.
  - Integrate and transport data to the warehouse.
  - Load data into structured formats for storage and processing.

- Data cleaning and processing happen after storage to remove noise and irrelevant data.

- Common data models for organizing data include Star Schema and Snowflake Schema.

- Tools like Oracle Data Integrator and Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services help with integrating data from different sources.

- After data collection and cleaning, meaningful insights are extracted through **data mining**, using tools like Python, R, Power BI, and Tableau.

- Big companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon maintain large physical data warehouses, while smaller companies might use cloud services like Google's BigQuery.

- Challenges in data warehouse management include infrastructure setup, data storage, and environmental controls like temperature and humidity.

- Data warehousing enables business growth through analytics and better decision-making by mining stored data instead of relying on raw transactional data alone.
