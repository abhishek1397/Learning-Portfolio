# Research Methodology – Introduction

## Meaning of Research

- The word “Research” comes from two words: “Re” (again) and “Search” (to find).
- Research is a systematic and scientific search for finding new facts, figures, or discoveries in any branch of knowledge using careful investigation and inquiry.
  
### Expert Definition (Clifford Woody)

- Clifford Woody defines research as:
   "Research comprises defining and redefining problems;  formulating hypotheses or suggested solutions;  collecting, organizing, and evaluating data;  making deductions and conclusions;  and testing whether these fit the formulated hypothesis."  
  
- This definition covers all key steps of the research process.

### The Research Process – Main Steps

 Research is not sudden; it follows a sequence of steps:
  
  1. **Defining & redefining the problem** – Clearly stating the problem.
  2. **Formulating hypothesis of suggested solutions** – Making assumptions to be tested.It involves systematic and scientific search for new informat
  3. **Collecting data** – Gathering relevant information.
  4. **Organizing data** – Arranging data systematically.
  5. **Evaluating data** – Analyzing the collected data.
  6. **Making deductions and conclusions** – Drawing insights and conclusions.
  7. **Carefully testing conclusions** – Ensuring conclusions fit the hypothesis.

#### Why is Research Important?
- Research is a journey of discovery. Curiosity, or the desire to know something new, is the driving force behind research and all inventions (example given: Newton and gravity).

### Objectives & Purpose of Research

Different studies have different objectives, based on the research type:
  
1. **Exploratory (Formulative) Research:** Gaining familiarity with new phenomena and achieving new insights.
   - Example: Exploring the role of social media in marketing communications.
2. **Descriptive Research:** Accurately describing characteristics or features of individuals, situations, or groups as they are.
   - Example: Studying buying preferences of consumers in a city.
3. **Diagnostic Research:** Determining the frequency with which something occurs or is associated with something else.
   - Example: Studying the frequency and characteristics of an infection (e.g., COVID-19).
4. **Hypothesis Testing Research:** Testing assumptions and studying the causal relationship between variables.
   - Example: Investigating whether the fall in car sales is related to the rise in work-from-home culture.

## Types of Research

1. **Descriptive Research**
   - Focuses on describing the present state of affairs “as it exists.”
   - The researcher has **no control over variables**; mainly reports what is happening/happened.
   - Example: Studying customer preferences for electronic goods—what do customers prefer, how often do they shop, etc.
   - Commonly uses **survey methods**.

2. **Analytical Research**
   - Centers on analyzing already available data/facts, performing critical evaluation.
   - The researcher analyzes pre-collected data to extract findings and insights.
   - Example: Evaluating five years of a company's stock prices to find trends and conclusions.

3. **Applied Research**
   - Conducted to find solutions for **immediate problems** facing society, businesses, or industry.
   - Has direct practical application and usefulness.
   - Example: Studying the effects of economic or political trends on organizations.

4. **Fundamental (Pure/Basic) Research**
   - Concerned with **generating new theories**, generalizations, or refining existing knowledge.
   - Aims to expand the frontiers of knowledge, not to solve immediate practical problems.
   - Example: Generalizing human behavior, mathematical research, or studies of natural phenomena like global warming.

5. **Quantitative Research**
   - Involves the study of **quantifiable variables**; data is in numbers/figures.
   - Deals with measurable aspects—statistical, numerical, or factual data.
   - Example: Analyzing stock market, company share prices, frequency data, or other measurable trends.

6. **Qualitative Research**
   - Emphasizes **quality or behavior**, not measured in numbers.
   - Suitable for studying motivation, attitudes, opinions, and behaviors.
   - Example: Human behavior studies, motivation, consumer preferences.
   - Methods include sentence completion tests, story completion tests, etc.

7. **Attitude & Opinion Research**
   - Subtype of qualitative research.
   - Studies how people **feel, think, or perceive** about a subject, brand, or product.
   - Example: Research on customer perceptions, product preferences.

8. **Conceptual vs. Empirical Research**
   - **Conceptual Research:** Based on existing **theories, concepts, or abstract ideas**. Revisiting or redefining theories.
   - **Empirical (Experimental) Research:** Based on **experiments, experience, and observation**. Collects fresh data and draws new conclusions from real-life experiments, especially in behavioral studies.

9. **One-Time vs. Longitudinal Research**
   - **One-Time Research:** Conducted over a **specific, limited period** (months/years), then ends.
   - **Longitudinal Research:** Conducted over a **longer, extended period**—often years or decades. For example, ongoing studies on the universe or galaxies.

10. **Field Setting, Laboratory, and Simulation Research**
    - Defined by the environment:
      - **Field Setting Research:** Conducted in real-life environments (e.g., markets, companies, hospitals).
      - **Laboratory Research:** Conducted in controlled, laboratory settings (e.g., medical research).
      - **Simulation Research:** Conducted in artificially created environments mimicking the real one (e.g., astronaut or space research using simulators).

11. **Historical Research**
    - Involves studying old documents, books, fossils, or historical remnants to understand the past.
      

##### Key Concepts

- A **single research project** can have characteristics from more than one type (e.g., it can be both descriptive and quantitative if it describes things as they are using numbers).
- but only one type from **mutually exclusive pairs** is chosen for each aspect (e.g., descriptive vs analytical; quantitative vs qualitative; conceptual vs empirical; one-time vs longitudinal).

***

## Research Process: Key Steps

1. **Selection of Research Problem**
   - The first and most critical step is to identify and clearly define the research problem. Without understanding the problem, research cannot proceed meaningfully.

2. **Review of Literature**
   - Study existing literature, works, and research relating to the selected problem. This helps understand what is already known, identify gaps, and avoid duplication.

3. **Formulation of Hypothesis**
   - A hypothesis is a testable assumption or prediction about relationships between variables. It provides direction to data collection and analysis.

4. **Research Design**
   - This step involves planning how the research will be carried out—
     - What data to collect?
     - Which tools to use?
     - Which population and sample size?
   - Decides the methods and procedures for data collection and analysis.

5. **Sample Selection**
   - Decide on a **sample** (subset) from the total population. The sample should be representative and chosen using an appropriate sampling technique.

6. **Data Collection**
   - Collect necessary primary or secondary data as per the design. Methods include surveys, interviews, observations, experiments, etc..

7. **Data Analysis and Interpretation**
   - Analyze the collected data using appropriate statistical or qualitative methods. Interpret findings to draw conclusions.

8. **Testing Hypothesis**
   - Based on the analysis, the hypothesis is either accepted or rejected. This determines whether assumptions made at the start hold true.

9. **Report Writing and Presentation**
   - Prepare a detailed research report outlining objectives, methodology, data analysis, findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

### Flow of Research Process

| Step | Activity                       |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | Select Research Problem        |
| 2    | Review of Literature           |
| 3    | Formulation of Hypothesis      |
| 4    | Preparing Research Design      |
| 5    | Sample Selection               |
| 6    | Data Collection                |
| 7    | Data Analysis & Interpretation |
| 8    | Testing Hypothesis             |
| 9    | Research Report Writing        |


#### Key Points
- All steps are essential for scientific, systematic research.
- Attention to each stage ensures reliable findings and valid conclusions. 
- Interlinking of steps: Later stages depend upon earlier ones (e.g., good hypothesis requires sound literature review, and valid analysis requires quality data collection).

***

## What is Sample Design?
- **Sample design** is a fundamental aspect of research methodology.
- It refers to the plan or strategy used to select a *sample* (subset) from a larger population for a research study.[1]
- The sample should be representative to ensure the validity and reliability of research findings.[1]

### Types of Sampling

1. **Probability Sampling**
   - Every member of the population has a *known, non-zero chance* of being selected.[1]
   - Ensures that the sample is unbiased and representative.
   - Common methods:
     - **Simple Random Sampling:** Each individual has an equal chance of being chosen.
     - **Systematic Sampling:** Selection based on a fixed interval (e.g., every 10th person).
     - **Stratified Sampling:** Population is divided into subgroups (strata), and samples are drawn from each.
     - **Cluster Sampling:** Population divided into clusters, some clusters are selected randomly, and all members of chosen clusters are included.

2. **Non-Probability Sampling**
   - The probability of selection for each member is *unknown or zero*.[1]
   - May introduce bias, but is used when probability sampling isn’t possible.
   - Common methods:
     - **Convenience Sampling:** Selecting individuals who are easiest to reach.
     - **Judgment/Purposive Sampling:** Researcher selects based on specific traits or purpose.
     - **Quota Sampling:** Ensures that certain characteristics are represented by setting quotas.
     - **Snowball Sampling:** Existing participants recruit future subjects (common in hard-to-reach populations).


### Importance of Sample Design

- Good sample design enhances accuracy and generalizability of research conclusions.[1]
- Helps in efficiently managing time, cost, and resources.
- It directly affects the credibility of the study’s outcomes.


#### Conclusion

- **Probability sampling** is preferred for scientific research due to its ability to provide unbiased samples.
- **Non-probability sampling** is used in situations where it’s difficult or impractical to conduct probability sampling.[1]

   - Respondents or organizations may not cooperate fully in data collection.[1]

5. **Difficulty in Formulating Hypotheses**
   - Challenges in forming clear, testable assumptions can hinder progress.[1]

6. **Lack of Proper Guidance**
   - Limited mentorship leads to misdirection and errors in research design and execution.[1]

7. **Time Constraints**
   - Balancing research activities with other responsibilities is often difficult for students and professionals.[1]

#### Conclusion
- Good research is systematic, objective, accurate, ethical, and provides results that can be generalized and replicated.[1]
- Addressing problems like data access, skills, guidance, and finances is crucial for improving the quality and impact of research in India.[1]

### Inductive vs Deductive Research – Research Aptitude (UGC NET Exam)  

#### Inductive Research  
- **Definition:** Moves from *specific observations* to *generalizations* and theory development.  
- **Process:** Bottom-up approach – start with specific instances or data, then generalize to broader theories or conclusions.  
- **Example:**  
  - Observing that specific black dogs bark loudly.  
  - From these observations, generalizing that all black dogs bark loudly (theory development).  
  - Example in history: Newton observing falling apple and developing the gravitational theory by generalizing from specific observations.  
- Mainly used in **qualitative research**.  
- Helps to **develop new theories** based on observed data.

#### Deductive Research  
- **Definition:** Moves from *general theory* to *specific instances* to test that theory.  
- **Process:** Top-down approach – start with an existing theory or hypothesis, then test it with specific observations or experiments.  
- **Example:**  
  - Having a theory that all black dogs bark loudly.  
  - Testing this theory by observing individual black dogs in a locality.  
  - If observations contradict (some black dogs do not bark loudly), the theory may be rejected or modified.  
- Mostly used in **quantitative research** or scientific research.  
- Involves **hypothesis formulation and testing** based on pre-existing theories.

#### Key Differences  
| Aspect                | Inductive Research                    | Deductive Research                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Direction             | Specific to General (Bottom-up)     | General to Specific (Top-down)      |
| Purpose               | Develop new theories                 | Test existing theories              |
| Starting Point        | Specific observations/data          | Existing theory/hypothesis          |
| Typical Use           | Qualitative research                 | Quantitative/scientific research    |
| Process Emphasis      | Pattern recognition and generalization | Hypothesis formulation and testing  |

***

#### Summary  
- Inductive research builds theories by examining specific details and making generalizations.  
- Deductive research starts with theory and tests it with specific observations or data.  
- Both approaches are essential in research and used based on the nature of the study.  
- Understanding these approaches is important for UGC NET and other research aptitude exams.

#### Concept of Theory: Deductive and Inductive Theory

- **Theory:**  
  A well-substantiated explanation of phenomena that integrates facts, laws, and tested hypotheses. Supports understanding, prediction, and control in research.

- **Inductive Theory:**  
  - Process of constructing theories by moving from specific observations to generalized explanations.  
  - It is an empirical approach where patterns or regularities observed in data lead to formulation of broader theoretical frameworks.  
  - Known as **bottom-up reasoning**.  
  - Example: Observation of falling objects leads to Newton’s law of gravitation.  
  - Primarily used in exploratory and qualitative research.  

- **Deductive Theory:**  
  - Begins with existing theory or general principle, from which specific hypotheses are derived and tested through empirical observation.  
  - Known as **top-down reasoning**.  
  - It validates or refutes the hypotheses in specific contexts.  
  - Example: Using established economic theories to test consumer behavior patterns in a particular market.  
  - Common in quantitative and experimental research.

- **Comparison:**  
  | Aspect           | Inductive                     | Deductive                     |
  |------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
  | Approach         | Bottom-up                    | Top-down                     |
  | Start point      | Specific observations        | General theory               |
  | Outcome          | Theory development           | Theory testing               |
  | Research focus   | Exploratory                  | Confirmatory                 |
  | Common use       | Qualitative research         | Quantitative research        |

#### Understanding the Language of Research

- Research communication requires precision and clarity. Specialized terminology ensures unambiguous interpretation of concepts.  
- Core elements:  
  - **Concepts:** Abstract ideas representing phenomena or constructs.  
  - **Constructs:** Complex, theoretical concepts designed for scientific study, often not directly observable.  
  - **Variables:** Operational representations of concepts used in empirical testing.  
  - **Definitions:** Clarify meaning; differentiate between *conceptual* (theory-based) and *operational* (measurement-based) definitions.

***

#### Key Research Terms

- **Concept:**  
  An abstract idea or mental image representing a phenomenon or class of phenomena. It forms the foundation of theory building.  
  Examples: Leadership, intelligence, customer satisfaction.

- **Construct:**  
  A higher-order conceptual variable explicitly created for theoretical and empirical investigation, often combining multiple concepts.  
  Example: Emotional intelligence is a construct comprising multiple psychological attributes.

- **Definition:**  
  - **Conceptual Definition:** A theoretical meaning that describes what the concept represents.  
  - **Operational Definition:** Defines how the concept will be measured or identified in the specific context of research.  
  Clarity in definitions enhances validity and reproducibility of research.  

- **Variable:**  
  An attribute or characteristic that can assume different values among subjects or over time. Essential for empirical research.  
  Types include:  
  - **Independent Variable (IV):** The presumed cause or predictor.  
  - **Dependent Variable (DV):** The presumed effect or outcome.  
  - **Control Variable:** Variables held constant to prevent confounding.  
  - **Moderator and Mediator Variables:** Variables that influence or explain the relationship between IV and DV.

## Useful YouTube Videos & Tutorials

I found one relevant video that you’ll likely find helpful:

[How to use SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) for journal metrics explanations](https://www.solutions4statistics.com/post/2017/07/30/journal-ranking-metrics?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This video demonstrates how to use the SCImago site (scimagojr.com) to explore SJR and h‑index metrics for journals—perfect for understanding how these metrics are applied in real cases. It also covers other metrics explained in context.([solutions4statistics.com][1])


## Core Concepts Explained

Here’s a brief overview of the key journal metrics and indexing concepts covered in your question, based on credible sources:

### 1. **Journal Impact Factor (JIF) / Impact Factor (IF)**

* Calculates the average citations in a given year to articles published in the journal during the previous two years.([Wikipedia][2])
* Example: IF₍2017₎ = total citations in 2017 to 2015–2016 articles ÷ number of citable articles in those years.([Wikipedia][2])
* Used widely but criticized for oversimplification, field bias, and susceptibility to manipulation.([Wikipedia][2])

### 2. **SCImago Journal Rank (SJR)**

* A prestige-weighted metric: citations from more prestigious journals count more.([Wikipedia][3])
* Based on Scopus data, calculated over a three-year window.([Wikipedia][3], [in.sagepub.com][4])

### 3. **CiteScore**

* Scopus-based metric similar to IF, but spans four years and includes more document types (e.g., book chapters, etc.).([aut.ac.nz.libguides.com][5], [in.sagepub.com][4])

### 4. **h‑Index**

* Measures a journal's or researcher's productivity and citations: the highest value h such that there are h publications with at least h citations each.([Wikipedia][6])
* Different databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) yield different values due to coverage and indexing differences.([Wikipedia][6])

### 5. **Additional Metrics**

* **Eigenfactor and Article Influence** – Weigh citations by prestige, spanning five years.([www.slideshare.net][7])
* **Immediacy Index** – Average citations in the same year of publication.([www.slideshare.net][7])
* **SNIP (Source Normalized Impact per Paper)** – Normalizes citations by field, helping cross-field comparisons.([aut.ac.nz.libguides.com][5], [in.sagepub.com][4])
* **Cited Half-Life**, **Quartile Rankings (Q1, Q2, …)** – Additional evaluative tools.([aut.ac.nz.libguides.com][5])

### 6. **Indexing & Journal Types**

* Journals may be general or specialized; each has different visibility, acceptance rates, and scope.([www.slideshare.net][7])
* Common indexing platforms: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, DOAJ, UGC‑CARE, etc.([www.slideshare.net][7])

## Recommendation for M.Tech Students

1. **Watch the video above**—it’s practical and shows how to navigate SJR and interpret its scores.
2. **Use scimagojr.com** yourself to explore live examples of SJR and h-index metrics.
3. **Understand each metric's pros and cons**—especially in how they relate to your field and selection of journals.
4. **Consider other metrics and indexing databases** when choosing where to publish or evaluating journals.
5. **Look for course-specific or institution-specific tutorials**—many academic institutions publish their own explainers (e.g., slides from stands like Slideshare).([www.slideshare.net][8])
