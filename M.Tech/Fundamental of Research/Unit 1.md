# Research Methodology – Introduction

## Meaning of Research

- The word “Research” comes from two words: “Re” (again) and “Search” (to find).
- Research is a systematic and scientific search for finding new facts, figures, or discoveries in any branch of knowledge using careful investigation and inquiry.
  
### Expert Definition (Clifford Woody)

- Clifford Woody defines research as:
   "Research comprises defining and redefining problems;  formulating hypotheses or suggested solutions;  collecting, organizing, and evaluating data;  making deductions and conclusions;  and testing whether these fit the formulated hypothesis."  
  
- This definition covers all key steps of the research process.

### The Research Process – Main Steps

 Research is not sudden; it follows a sequence of steps:
  
  1. **Defining & redefining the problem** – Clearly stating the problem.
  2. **Formulating hypothesis of suggested solutions** – Making assumptions to be tested.It involves systematic and scientific search for new informat
  3. **Collecting data** – Gathering relevant information.
  4. **Organizing data** – Arranging data systematically.
  5. **Evaluating data** – Analyzing the collected data.
  6. **Making deductions and conclusions** – Drawing insights and conclusions.
  7. **Carefully testing conclusions** – Ensuring conclusions fit the hypothesis.

#### Why is Research Important?
- Research is a journey of discovery. Curiosity, or the desire to know something new, is the driving force behind research and all inventions (example given: Newton and gravity).

### Objectives & Purpose of Research

Different studies have different objectives, based on the research type:
  
1. **Exploratory (Formulative) Research:** Gaining familiarity with new phenomena and achieving new insights.
   - Example: Exploring the role of social media in marketing communications.
2. **Descriptive Research:** Accurately describing characteristics or features of individuals, situations, or groups as they are.
   - Example: Studying buying preferences of consumers in a city.
3. **Diagnostic Research:** Determining the frequency with which something occurs or is associated with something else.
   - Example: Studying the frequency and characteristics of an infection (e.g., COVID-19).
4. **Hypothesis Testing Research:** Testing assumptions and studying the causal relationship between variables.
   - Example: Investigating whether the fall in car sales is related to the rise in work-from-home culture.

## Types of Research

1. **Descriptive Research**
   - Focuses on describing the present state of affairs “as it exists.”
   - The researcher has **no control over variables**; mainly reports what is happening/happened.
   - Example: Studying customer preferences for electronic goods—what do customers prefer, how often do they shop, etc.
   - Commonly uses **survey methods**.

2. **Analytical Research**
   - Centers on analyzing already available data/facts, performing critical evaluation.
   - The researcher analyzes pre-collected data to extract findings and insights.
   - Example: Evaluating five years of a company's stock prices to find trends and conclusions.

3. **Applied Research**
   - Conducted to find solutions for **immediate problems** facing society, businesses, or industry.
   - Has direct practical application and usefulness.
   - Example: Studying the effects of economic or political trends on organizations.

4. **Fundamental (Pure/Basic) Research**
   - Concerned with **generating new theories**, generalizations, or refining existing knowledge.
   - Aims to expand the frontiers of knowledge, not to solve immediate practical problems.
   - Example: Generalizing human behavior, mathematical research, or studies of natural phenomena like global warming.

5. **Quantitative Research**
   - Involves the study of **quantifiable variables**; data is in numbers/figures.
   - Deals with measurable aspects—statistical, numerical, or factual data.
   - Example: Analyzing stock market, company share prices, frequency data, or other measurable trends.

6. **Qualitative Research**
   - Emphasizes **quality or behavior**, not measured in numbers.
   - Suitable for studying motivation, attitudes, opinions, and behaviors.
   - Example: Human behavior studies, motivation, consumer preferences.
   - Methods include sentence completion tests, story completion tests, etc.

7. **Attitude & Opinion Research**
   - Subtype of qualitative research.
   - Studies how people **feel, think, or perceive** about a subject, brand, or product.
   - Example: Research on customer perceptions, product preferences.

8. **Conceptual vs. Empirical Research**
   - **Conceptual Research:** Based on existing **theories, concepts, or abstract ideas**. Revisiting or redefining theories.
   - **Empirical (Experimental) Research:** Based on **experiments, experience, and observation**. Collects fresh data and draws new conclusions from real-life experiments, especially in behavioral studies.

9. **One-Time vs. Longitudinal Research**
   - **One-Time Research:** Conducted over a **specific, limited period** (months/years), then ends.
   - **Longitudinal Research:** Conducted over a **longer, extended period**—often years or decades. For example, ongoing studies on the universe or galaxies.

10. **Field Setting, Laboratory, and Simulation Research**
    - Defined by the environment:
      - **Field Setting Research:** Conducted in real-life environments (e.g., markets, companies, hospitals).
      - **Laboratory Research:** Conducted in controlled, laboratory settings (e.g., medical research).
      - **Simulation Research:** Conducted in artificially created environments mimicking the real one (e.g., astronaut or space research using simulators).

11. **Historical Research**
    - Involves studying old documents, books, fossils, or historical remnants to understand the past.
      

##### Key Concepts

- A **single research project** can have characteristics from more than one type (e.g., it can be both descriptive and quantitative if it describes things as they are using numbers).
- but only one type from **mutually exclusive pairs** is chosen for each aspect (e.g., descriptive vs analytical; quantitative vs qualitative; conceptual vs empirical; one-time vs longitudinal).

## Research Process: Key Steps

1. **Selection of Research Problem**
   - The first and most critical step is to identify and clearly define the research problem. Without understanding the problem, research cannot proceed meaningfully.

2. **Review of Literature**
   - Study existing literature, works, and research relating to the selected problem. This helps understand what is already known, identify gaps, and avoid duplication.

3. **Formulation of Hypothesis**
   - A hypothesis is a testable assumption or prediction about relationships between variables. It provides direction to data collection and analysis.

4. **Research Design**
   - This step involves planning how the research will be carried out—
     - What data to collect?
     - Which tools to use?
     - Which population and sample size?
   - Decides the methods and procedures for data collection and analysis.

5. **Sample Selection**
   - Decide on a **sample** (subset) from the total population. The sample should be representative and chosen using an appropriate sampling technique.

6. **Data Collection**
   - Collect necessary primary or secondary data as per the design. Methods include surveys, interviews, observations, experiments, etc..

7. **Data Analysis and Interpretation**
   - Analyze the collected data using appropriate statistical or qualitative methods. Interpret findings to draw conclusions.

8. **Testing Hypothesis**
   - Based on the analysis, the hypothesis is either accepted or rejected. This determines whether assumptions made at the start hold true.

9. **Report Writing and Presentation**
   - Prepare a detailed research report outlining objectives, methodology, data analysis, findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

### Flow of Research Process

| Step | Activity                       |

#### Key Points
- All steps are essential for scientific, systematic research.
- Attention to each stage ensures reliable findings and valid conclusions. 
- Interlinking of steps: Later stages depend upon earlier ones (e.g., good hypothesis requires sound literature review, and valid analysis requires quality data collection).

## What is Sample Design?
- **Sample design** is a fundamental aspect of research methodology.
- It refers to the plan or strategy used to select a *sample* (subset) from a larger population for a research study.[1]
- The sample should be representative to ensure the validity and reliability of research findings.[1]

### Types of Sampling

1. **Probability Sampling**
   - Every member of the population has a *known, non-zero chance* of being selected.[1]
   - Ensures that the sample is unbiased and representative.
   - Common methods:
     - **Simple Random Sampling:** Each individual has an equal chance of being chosen.
     - **Systematic Sampling:** Selection based on a fixed interval (e.g., every 10th person).
     - **Stratified Sampling:** Population is divided into subgroups (strata), and samples are drawn from each.
     - **Cluster Sampling:** Population divided into clusters, some clusters are selected randomly, and all members of chosen clusters are included.

2. **Non-Probability Sampling**
   - The probability of selection for each member is *unknown or zero*.[1]
   - May introduce bias, but is used when probability sampling isn’t possible.
   - Common methods:
     - **Convenience Sampling:** Selecting individuals who are easiest to reach.
     - **Judgment/Purposive Sampling:** Researcher selects based on specific traits or purpose.
     - **Quota Sampling:** Ensures that certain characteristics are represented by setting quotas.
     - **Snowball Sampling:** Existing participants recruit future subjects (common in hard-to-reach populations).


### Importance of Sample Design

- Good sample design enhances accuracy and generalizability of research conclusions.[1]
- Helps in efficiently managing time, cost, and resources.
- It directly affects the credibility of the study’s outcomes.


#### Conclusion

- **Probability sampling** is preferred for scientific research due to its ability to provide unbiased samples.
- **Non-probability sampling** is used in situations where it’s difficult or impractical to conduct probability sampling.[1]
