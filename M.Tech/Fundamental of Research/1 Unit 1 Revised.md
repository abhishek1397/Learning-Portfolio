# Meaning of Research 

## What is Research?
Research is a **systematic process for generating new knowledge**. At its core, research is the disciplined attempt to answer questions that don't yet have clear answers. It involves identifying a significant question or problem, collecting or analyzing evidence, and building an argument or explanation supported by that evidence.

> "Research involves making novel contributions to a scholarly literature — it's not just repeating what's already known, but asking: 'What *don’t* we know, and how can we find out?'"[1][5][6]

## Why 'Systematic'? 
Unlike everyday inquiry, research follows specific steps, ensuring methods are explicit and conclusions are trustworthy. This means:
- Starting with a **well-defined question**
- Using **transparent procedures** for collecting and analyzing data
- Critically evaluating results before drawing conclusions

## Two Key Elements
1. **Curiosity:** Research begins with a desire to know, understand, or solve something unknown.
2. **Rigor:** The process must be disciplined and methodical, not haphazard or anecdotal.

## Research Across Disciplines
While methods vary (e.g., experiments in biology, interviews in sociology, simulations in computer science), the *spirit* of research remains the same: uncover new insights through careful, logical study.

Here are professional notes on the topic **Research Methods vs. Methodology** from Chapter 1 of C.R. Kothari's "Research Methodology," structured for advanced learners as a Harvard or Stanford professor would present them:[1]

***

# Research Methods vs. Methodology

### 1. **Research Methods**
- Refer to the specific techniques, procedures, and tools used to conduct research and collect or analyze data.
- Examples include surveys, experiments, interviews, observations, statistical and analytical procedures.
- Methods can be grouped:
  - **Data Collection:** Observation, survey, interview, case study.
  - **Data Analysis:** Regression, factor analysis, ANOVA, coding, tabulation.
  - **Accuracy Evaluation:** Validation and reliability tests.

### 2. **Research Methodology**
- Encompasses the logic, rationale, and strategy guiding the entire research process.
- Involves the study of how and why methods are applied, how a research problem is defined, hypothesis formulation, choice of data collection and analysis techniques, and justification for these choices.
- Ensures coherence, rigor, and transparency in research—making results evaluable and reproducible.

### 3. **Key Differences**

| Aspect           | Research Methods                                           | Research Methodology                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope            | Specific techniques/tools                                  | Overall strategy, logic, framework                     |
| Function         | How research is performed                                 | Why particular methods/strategies are selected         |
| Example          | Conducting surveys, regression analysis                   | Deciding why to use a survey vs. experiment; theory-driven framework |
| Relationship     | Components within a methodology                           | Methodology subsumes and justifies chosen methods      |

- **Analogy:** Methods are tools; methodology is the blueprint or plan that explains why and how those tools are used.
- The methodology evaluates the appropriateness, assumptions, and logic of research decisions, while methods execute those decisions in practice.

### 4. **Why Distinguish Between the Two?**
- Effective research demands not only technical proficiency with methods but a critical, reflective approach to designing and justifying the sequence and selection of those methods.
- Methodology bridges theory and practice: it links research purpose, questions, techniques, and quality criteria so the study can be both replicable and insightful.

**Summary:**  
Research methods refer to what a researcher does; methodology refers to the thinking and justification behind those choices—the science of how research should be conducted. Distinguishing between the two improves the quality, credibility, and impact of any research project.[1]

## 📘 **5 Determining Sample Design – Notes**

### 🔹 1. Basic Concepts

| Term                      | Definition                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universe / Population** | All items under consideration in any field of inquiry.                                             |
| **Census Inquiry**        | Complete enumeration of all items in a population.                                                 |
| **Sample**                | A subset of items selected from the population for study.                                          |
| **Sample Design**         | A definite plan (decided *before* data collection) for obtaining a sample from a given population. |

#### ⚠️ Why not always use Census?

* Time-consuming, expensive, and energy-intensive.
* Difficult/impossible in many cases (e.g. blood tests).
* Bias may exist; checking bias requires re-survey/sample checks.

Hence, **sampling** is often preferred.


### 🔹 2. Types of Sampling Designs

Sampling designs are classified into **two main categories**:

| Type                         | Description                                                | Examples                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Probability Sampling**     | Every element has a *known* probability of being selected. | Simple Random, Systematic, Stratified, Cluster/Area, Multistage |
| **Non-Probability Sampling** | Probability of selection *not known*.                      | Convenience, Judgement, Quota, Purposive                        |


### 🔹 3. Major Sampling Techniques

#### (i) **Deliberate / Purposive Sampling** *(Non-Probability)*

* Researcher **intentionally selects** particular units.
* Includes:

  * **Convenience Sampling:** Based on ease of access (e.g., interviewing buyers at selected petrol stations).
  * **Judgement Sampling:** Based on researcher’s judgement of what’s representative (common in qualitative research).
* **Use:** When aim is *exploratory or hypothesis generation*, not generalization.
* **Limitation:** Prone to bias.


#### (ii) **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** *(Probability)*

* Each item in population has **equal chance** of inclusion.
* Example: Lottery method or random number table.
* Ensures unbiased representation.
* **In infinite populations:** Successive selections are independent.


#### (iii) **Systematic Sampling** *(Probability)*

* Select **every nth item** from an ordered list after a random start.
* Example: Every 10th house, every 15th name.
* **Condition:** Sampling frame (list) must exist.
* **Advantage:** Simple, quick, practical.
* **Risk:** Hidden patterns may bias results.


#### (iv) **Stratified Sampling** *(Probability)*

* Used when population is **heterogeneous**.
* Divide population into **strata** (non-overlapping subgroups).
* Select samples **randomly** from each stratum.
* **Goal:** Ensure representation of all subgroups.
* **Example:** Divide employees by department, then sample randomly within each.


#### (v) **Quota Sampling** *(Non-Probability)*

* Modified form of stratified sampling.
* Interviewers given **quotas** for each stratum (proportionate to population).
* Selection within quota left to **interviewer’s judgement**.
* **Used in:** Market surveys, opinion polls.
* **Nature:** Non-random → prone to bias.


#### (vi) **Cluster Sampling & Area Sampling** *(Probability)*

##### a) Cluster Sampling:

* Divide population into **clusters/groups**.
* Randomly select **entire clusters**, not individuals.
* Example: Store wants to sample credit card users → select 3 random clusters of 150 customers each from 100 clusters.
* **Pros:** Easier fieldwork, cost-effective.
* **Cons:** Less accuracy; higher sampling error.

##### b) Area Sampling:

* Similar to cluster sampling but based on **geographical divisions**.
* Useful when no population list exists.
* Example: Divide city into zones → randomly select few zones → survey all households there.


#### (vii) **Multi-Stage Sampling** *(Probability)*

* Extension of cluster sampling with **multiple stages of selection**.
* Example:

  1. Select States →
  2. Select Districts →
  3. Select Towns →
  4. Select Families.
* Random selection at each stage = **multi-stage random sampling**.
* **Use:** Large-scale national/international surveys.


#### (viii) **Sequential Sampling**

* Sample size **not fixed in advance**.
* Decisions made **step-by-step** based on ongoing results.
* **Use:** Acceptance sampling in quality control.
* **Complex** but efficient for decision-based sampling.


### 🔹 4. Mixed Sampling

* Combination of multiple sampling methods in one study.
* Example: Stratified + Systematic.
* **Purpose:** Achieve balance between accuracy, cost, and feasibility.


### 🔹 5. Choosing the Right Sampling Design
**Factors to Consider:**

1. Nature and purpose of the study.
2. Size and heterogeneity of population.
3. Time and cost constraints.
4. Availability of population list (sampling frame).
5. Required level of accuracy and reliability.

**General Rule:**
* Prefer **random sampling** → reduces bias and allows estimation of sampling error.
* Use **purposive sampling** → when population is small or specific characteristics are to be studied deeply.


### 🧭 **Quick Revision Table**

| Sampling Type | Probability | Example                    | Bias Risk  | Typical Use                 |

| Simple Random | ✔           | Lottery, random numbers    | Low        | General surveys             |
| Systematic    | ✔           | Every 10th house           | Medium     | Ordered lists               |
| Stratified    | ✔           | Sampling from each stratum | Low        | Heterogeneous population    |
| Cluster       | ✔           | Selecting clusters/groups  | Medium     | Large, dispersed population |
| Multi-stage   | ✔           | State → District → Town    | Low–Medium | National surveys            |
| Convenience   | ✖           | Easy-to-reach units        | High       | Preliminary studies         |
| Judgement     | ✖           | Expert-selected units      | High       | Qualitative research        |
| Quota         | ✖           | Fixed quotas per stratum   | High       | Market studies              |
| Sequential    | ✔           | Ongoing decision-based     | Low        | Quality control             |


### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

* Sampling saves **time, money, and effort** compared to census.
* **Random sampling** minimizes bias.
* **Non-random sampling** is useful for exploratory or cost-limited studies.
* **Choice of sampling design** depends on study objectives, resources, and population characteristics.
