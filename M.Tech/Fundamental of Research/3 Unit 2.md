# 🔍 **Advanced Research Methodology – Key Notes**

---

## 1. **Research Question vs. Investigation Question**

### **Research Question**

* **Definition**: Formal, specific queries that guide a study.
* **Purpose**: Structured, testable queries defining the population, variables, and objectives.
* **Criteria**: Should meet **FINER** – *Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant*.
* **Types**:

  * **Quantitative**: Structured; uses PICOT framework.
  * **Qualitative**: Exploratory; uses PEO framework.
  * **Mixed-Methods**: Combines both.
* **Significance**: Drives methodology; central to formal, hypothesis-driven research.

### **Investigation Question**

* **Definition**: Flexible, broader questions used for exploration or preliminary study.
* **Purpose**: Used in early-stage research, pilot studies, journalism, etc.
* **Application**: Not rigid; may guide evidence collection.
* **Role**: Supports development of research questions; informs hypothesis formation.

## 2. **Measurement Issues: The Triad of Sound Measurement**

### A. **Validity** *(Accuracy of measurement)*

* **Content Validity**: Covers the full domain of the concept.
* **Criterion Validity**:

  * *Predictive*: Forecasts future outcomes.
  * *Concurrent*: Correlates with existing validated tools.
* **Construct Validity**: Assesses alignment with theoretical constructs.

### B. **Reliability** *(Consistency of results)*

* **Stability (Test-Retest)**: Same results over time.
* **Equivalency**:

  * *Alternate forms* (tool reliability).
  * *Inter-rater* (observer consistency).
* **Internal Consistency**: Consistency within a multi-item tool.

### C. **Practicality** *(Operational feasibility)*

* **Economy**: Cost-effectiveness vs. rigor.
* **Convenience**: Ease of use and administration.
* **Interpretability**: Results should be understandable to non-designers.

> **Note**: Validity is most critical; reliability supports validity; practicality ensures real-world usability.

## 3. **Literature Survey & Research Gap Identification**

### A. **Literature Survey**

* **Purpose**: Informs hypothesis, narrows scope, validates methodology.
* **Types**:

  * **Conceptual Literature**: Theories and concepts.
  * **Empirical Literature**: Previous studies and findings.
* **Sources**: Journals, reports, bibliographies, conference papers, etc.

### B. **Identifying Research Gaps**

* **Definition**: Areas with missing, incomplete, or conflicting knowledge.
* **Process**:

  * Review conclusions and limitations of studies for "gap language" (e.g., "future research should...").
  * Identify contradictions in existing studies.
  * Use matrices or thematic maps to synthesize findings.
  * Involve stakeholders to ensure practical relevance.
  * Refine the gap based on resources, scope, and feasibility.

## 4. **Problem Identification & Constructing the Problem Statement**

### A. **Problem Identification**

(As per **Ackoff’s model**, p. 24–25)
A true research problem must have:

1. **Identifiable Subject**: Who is affected?
2. **Environment (N)**: Contains uncontrolled variables (Yj).
3. **Alternative Actions**: At least two courses (C1, C2).
4. **Multiple Outcomes**: At least two possible results (O1, O2).
5. **Uncertainty**: Probabilities differ between actions (P(O1|C1) ≠ P(O1|C2)).

### B. **Constructing the Problem Statement**

* **Contextualization**: Define current vs. desired state.
* **Clarity**: Specify the exact issue and knowledge gap.
* **Relevance**: Who is affected? Why does it matter?
* **Objectives**: State what the research aims to achieve.
* **Human-Centered Framing**: Focus on user needs, not just technical problems.
* **Scope**: Broad enough for innovation; narrow enough for feasibility.
* **Governance Role**: Helps align stakeholders, prevent scope creep, and manage risk.

## 5. **Potential Research Areas vs. Thrust Areas**

| **Category**        | **Definition**                                        | **Characteristics**                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Potential Areas** | Broad, academically valuable domains for exploration. | Not urgent; often exploratory or early-stage. May lack targeted funding.                         |
| **Thrust Areas**    | Strategically prioritized research zones.             | Defined by funders (e.g., UGC, ICMR); tied to national priorities; attract grants and deadlines. |

> **Insight**: Funding acts as an exogenous variable influencing research direction, often requiring alignment with thrust areas for feasibility and support.

## 6. **Scientific Literature vs. Advocacy Literature**

| **Aspect**            | **Scientific Literature**           | **Advocacy Literature**                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**              | Objective truth-seeking             | Cause-driven persuasion                        |
| **Ethical Stance**    | Neutral, impersonal, logical        | Prescriptive, ideological                      |
| **Rigor**             | Systematic, replicable, data-driven | May prioritize impact over rigor               |
| **Scope of Findings** | Bound by data and method            | May overgeneralize or exceed scientific limits |

> **Critical Note**: Blending scientific authority with advocacy undermines objectivity. Professionals must separate roles to maintain integrity of scientific work.
