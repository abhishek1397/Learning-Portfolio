## 4. **Problem Identification & Constructing the Problem Statement**

Problem Identification and Constructing the Problem Statement (as per Industry and Societal Needs)


## **A. Problem Identification**

Problem identification is the process of recognizing and defining an issue that requires systematic investigation. A true research problem must be **theoretically grounded**, **practically relevant**, and **socially meaningful**.

### **1. Ackoff’s Model of a True Research Problem**

(As per Ackoff, 1974; p. 24–25)

A true research problem must have the following five essential components:

| Criterion                        | Description                                              | Example (Industry/Society Context)                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identifiable Subject**         | Specifies *who is affected* by the problem.              | Workers, consumers, organizations, or communities.         |
| **Environment (N)**              | The *setting* that contains uncontrolled variables (Yj). | Market fluctuations, policy constraints, cultural factors. |
| **Alternative Actions (C1, C2)** | There must be *at least two possible courses of action.* | Using renewable vs. non-renewable energy sources.          |
| **Multiple Outcomes (O1, O2)**   | Each action should yield *different possible results.*   | Increase or decrease in cost, efficiency, or satisfaction. |
| **Uncertainty**                  | Probabilities of outcomes must *differ between actions.* | Risk of market adoption or social acceptance.              |

---

## **B. Constructing the Problem Statement**

Once the problem is identified, the next step is to formulate a clear, concise, and researchable **problem statement**.

### **Key Components:**

1. **Contextualization:** Define the **current situation** vs. the **desired state**.
   → Example: Despite advancements in digital healthcare, rural access remains limited.

2. **Clarity:** Specify the **exact issue** or **knowledge gap**.
   → Example: Limited adoption of telemedicine due to poor connectivity and low awareness.

3. **Relevance:** Identify **who is affected** and **why it matters**.
   → Example: Rural communities face healthcare inequality.

4. **Objectives:** State **what the research aims to achieve.**
   → Example: To design a scalable model for rural telemedicine adoption.

5. **Human-Centered Framing:** Focus on **user or stakeholder needs**, not only technical details.
   → Example: Understanding patient behavior and trust in digital consultations.

6. **Scope:** Ensure it is *broad enough* for innovation yet *narrow enough* for feasibility.

7. **Governance Role:** A well-constructed problem statement aligns **stakeholders**, prevents **scope creep**, and supports **risk management**.
