Here are comprehensive notes structured for **10-mark long-answer questions**, covering the basics to advanced concepts of IPR, specific laws, and the international regime.

# **Topic 1: Introduction to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**

### **1. Concept & Meaning**
*   **Definition:** Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the human mind, such as inventions, literary/artistic works, symbols, names, and images used in commerce.
*   **Nature of Right:** IPRs are legal rights granted to creators to protect these creations. They are **territorial** (apply within specific borders) and **time-bound** (expire after a set period).
*   **Core Objective:** The system aims to balance the interests of the creator (monopoly/reward) and the public (access to knowledge).

### **2. Theoretical Foundations (Why do we have IPR?)**
To answer a theoretical question, cite these four main jurisprudential theories:
1.  **Natural Rights Theory (John Locke):** Based on the "Labor Theory." If a person mixes their labor (mental or physical) with something, they have a natural right to own the fruit of that labor.
2.  **Utilitarian/Incentive Theory (Jeremy Bentham):** The dominant modern theory. It views IPR as a "social contract." Society grants a temporary monopoly to the creator as an incentive to disclose the invention. Without this, "free riders" would copy inventions, discouraging innovation.
3.  **Personhood Theory (Hegel):** Intellectual creations are an extension of the creator's personality. Protecting the work protects the individual's dignity (this forms the basis of "Moral Rights" in copyright).
4.  **Social Planning Theory:** IPR laws should foster a just culture. Rights can be limited if they harm society (e.g., Compulsory Licensing for public health).

### **3. Kinds of Intellectual Property**
IP is broadly divided into two categories:
*   **Industrial Property:** Includes Patents (inventions), Trademarks (branding), Industrial Designs (aesthetics), and Geographical Indications (origin-based quality).
*   **Copyright & Neighboring Rights:** Includes literary/artistic works and rights of performers/broadcasters.

# **Topic 2: Patents & The Indian Patent Act, 1970**

### **1. Introduction to Patents**
*   **Definition:** An exclusive right granted for an invention (product or process) that is **new**, involves an **inventive step**, and is capable of **industrial application**.
*   **The "Grand Bargain":** In exchange for a 20-year monopoly, the inventor must fully **disclose** the technical details to the public.

### **2. Evolution of Indian Patent Law (The Amendments)**
India transformed its law from a "Process Patent" regime to a "Product Patent" regime to comply with the **TRIPS Agreement** (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights).

*   **The Patent Act, 1970 (Original):** Focused on "process patents" for food and drugs to ensure affordable medicines. It did not grant product patents in these sectors.
*   **1999 Amendment (Transitional Phase):**
    *   Introduced **"Mailbox" applications**: Allowed filing for product patents in pharma/agrochemicals (to be examined later).
    *   **Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR):** A temporary 5-year right to sell a drug if a patent was obtained in another WTO country.
*   **2002 Amendment (Harmonization):**
    *   Extended the patent term to **20 years** for *all* inventions.
    *   Aligned rules with the **Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)**.
*   **2005 Amendment (The Watershed Moment - TRIPS Compliance):**
    *   **Product Patents:** Finally allowed product patents for food, pharma, and chemicals.
    *   **Abolished EMRs:** Replaced them with full product patents.
    *   **Section 3(d) Introduced:** A critical safeguard against "evergreening" (see below).

### **3. Key Sections for Exams**
*   **Section 3(d) - Anti-Evergreening:**
    *   *Concept:* Prevents companies from extending monopolies by making trivial changes to existing drugs.
    *   *Rule:* A new form of a known substance is **not patentable** unless it shows **significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy**.
    *   *Case Law:* *Novartis v. Union of India (2013)* – The Supreme Court rejected the patent for Glivec because the new form was not more effective than the old one.
*   **Section 25 - Opposition Proceedings:**
    *   **Pre-Grant:** "Any person" can oppose before the grant (public health safeguard).
    *   **Post-Grant:** Only a "person interested" (competitor) can oppose within 1 year of the grant.
*   **Section 84 - Compulsory Licensing (CL):**
    *   The government can force a patent holder to license a drug to a generic maker if the drug is unaffordable, unavailable, or not manufactured in India.
    *   *Example:* Granted to Natco Pharma for the drug *Nexavar*.

# **Topic 3: Copyrights & Neighboring Rights**

### **1. Concept & Principles**
*   **Scope:** Protects original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, as well as films and sound recordings.
*   **Core Principle:** Copyright protects the **expression** of an idea, not the idea itself.
*   **Registration:** Not mandatory; protection is automatic upon creation.
*   **Term:** Generally, Author’s lifetime + 60 years in India.

### **2. The Bundle of Rights**
*   **Economic Rights (Sec 14):** Right to reproduce, issue copies, perform in public, translate, and adapt.
*   **Moral Rights (Sec 57):** Based on the author's dignity.
    *   *Right of Paternity:* Right to claim authorship.
    *   *Right of Integrity:* Right to restrain distortion or mutilation that damages the author's reputation.

### **3. Neighboring (Related) Rights**
These are rights for those who assist in bringing content to the public.
*   **Performer's Rights:** For actors, singers, dancers (lasts 50 years).
*   **Broadcaster's Rights:** For TV/Radio organizations (lasts 25 years).

# **Topic 4: Trademarks (History & Law)**

### **1. Concept**
*   A trademark is a distinctive sign (word, logo, shape) capable of distinguishing the goods/services of one enterprise from another.
*   It protects consumers from deception and producers from unfair competition.

### **2. Historical Development**
*   **Ancient:** Usage dates back to 5000 BCE with Indian potters and Egyptian masonry marks.
*   **Medieval:** Guilds (e.g., England's Bakers' Marking Law of 1266) required marks to ensure quality.
*   **Modern:** Formal laws emerged in the 19th century (France 1857, UK 1875) allowing registration and suing for infringement.

### **3. Indian Trademark Law Evolution**
*   **Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958:** Covered only "Goods".
*   **Trade Marks Act, 1999 (Current Law):**
    *   Expanded to include **"Service Marks"** (e.g., for banking, education).
    *   Recognized **"Well-known Trademarks"** (protected across classes, e.g., Google or Tata).
    *   Aligned with TRIPS obligations.

# **Topic 5: The International Regime (TRIPS, WIPO, WTO)**

### **1. WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization)**
*   **Role:** The UN agency ("The Administrator") based in Geneva. It promotes IP protection but has no dispute settlement power.
*   **Key Treaties Administered:**
    *   *Paris Convention:* Industrial Property (Patents, Trademarks).
    *   *Berne Convention:* Copyright (Literary/Artistic).
    *   *PCT:* Patent Cooperation Treaty (International filing system).

### **2. WTO & TRIPS (The Enforcer)**
*   **TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of IPR):** It is Annex 1C of the WTO Agreement. It links IP rights to global trade.
*   **Mandates:**
    *   **National Treatment:** Treat foreign nationals the same as citizens.
    *   **Most-Favored-Nation (MFN):** Advantages given to one nation must be given to all.
    *   **Minimum Standards:** Required 20-year patent terms and product patents (forcing India's 2005 amendment).
*   **Enforcement:** Violations can lead to trade sanctions under the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism.

### **3. GATTS (General Agreement on Trade in Services)**
*   **Relation to IPR:** While TRIPS covers rights, GATTS covers the **trade in services** (consultancy, software, franchising).
*   **Relevance:** Service industries rely heavily on **Trade Secrets** and **Know-how** (undisclosed information), which are protected under TRIPS Article 39 to facilitate service trade under GATTS.
